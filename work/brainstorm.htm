I, Mudora, have been appointed as Sage and Royal Historian to our great King. His Majesty has tasked me with the documentation our young world's life, one that will be free of error and last unto the end of time. So that our descendants may recall the early days of the world's history and have the knowledge of the beginning from those who witness it, it is my wish to create a record that can be passed down from generation to generation; one that will record every detail of our new world's life, from beginning to end. To this end, I have enchanted this very book so that each new event that comes to pass in Hyrule shall be recorded without assistance. This shall be my contribution to the future greatness of Hyrule...</blockquote>

<h2>PROGRESSION</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ordon Village</li>
<ul>
<li>Ordon Festival is underway! Talk to villagers (including&nbsp;<a href="#mayorulo">Mayor Ulo</a>&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.6;">who tells you to get his lantern out of his house), then race to win the Ordon Shield from the Blacksmith. Speak with&nbsp;</span><a href="#spiritordona">Spirit Ordona</a>&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.6;">(in a torch), then&nbsp;</span><a href="#julita">Julita</a>&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.6;">who directs you to the sewers to find&nbsp;</span><a href="#crista">Crista</a></li>
<li>When she tells you about the odd structure (sewer access), check it out to find the&nbsp;<a href="#ordonsword">Ordon Sword</a>&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.6;">then save her from ChuChus who appear afterward.</span></li>
<li>Shop (Shield, replacement costs 100 rupees. Bomb bag, can't get until after 2nd wallet. Potions included as well)</li>
</ul>
<li><a href="#dungeon1">Eastern Ruins/Hyrulian Sewers (Ongoing Temple) - Earth/Shadow/Water themes</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Ordon Village</li>
<ul>
<li>After getting shield and sword, head back to Ordon Village and talk to Ordona who directs you to Faron Woods to find the Sacred Grove. Near the grove the Deku and Tokay are having a conflict over who can have the area, with the Tokay having recently arrived and the Deku not liking it. Monkeys are also there, watching the drama unfold.</li>
</ul>
<li><a href="#dungeon2">Sacred Grove - Sacred Grove Temple (2nd) - Forest/Earth themes</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Upon leaving the temple, a monkey steals your Book of Mudora page and runs off through the woods toward the beach.</li>
<li>Beach
<ul>
<li>Gerudo are there with their crashed ship, blocking access to the beach (which they're claiming). They ask you to find parts to repair their ship (you not knowing they're turning it into an airship) and agree to leave the beach when you do. They tell you about the Abandoned Pyramid in the desert which should contain the parts they need. They can't get in because it requires a special power (chosen by the Triforce) and they see that you have it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="#dungeon3">Desert Expanse - Abandoned Pyramid (3rd) - Desert/Metal/Shadow themes (remnants of Lanayru Mining Facility)</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Beach
<ul>
<li>Give the parts to the Gerudo and they leave the beach for the desert (after informing Link of their true intentions). Return to the woods to tell the Tokay the beach is theirs, thereby resolving the turf war.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Faron Woods
<ul>
<li>The monkeys are bored now that the Deku/Tokay conflict is over, so they turn their attention to Link. They jump up into the trees, throwing the page back and forth between them. Link has to shake a tree to get a monkey out, and has to pick the right one with the page.</li>
<li>Dekus see the monkeys give the Book page back to Link and mention the existance of the Library and suggest how to access it from the sewers/ruins. Access the sewers near the ruins by lifting the rock, then traverse the length of the sewer to emerge in North Hyrule.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Kasuto Town - Ancient Library (North Hyrule)
<ul>
<li>Isan (Kasuto's page) tells you that Kasuto was killed by a group of strange people who were trying to use the Book of Mudora to cast a spell. He tells you about how Kasuto divided the Book of Mudora before he died and about the Library. Read what books you can in the library, more will be readable as you find more of the Book of Mudora. After some reading, talk to Isan again to receive a copy of the Hyrulean Bestiary to give to the Relic Collector in Castle Town in exchange for the Ocarina of Wind)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ordon Village
<ul>
<li>Blacksmith's Cave (Will forge you a new sword if you can find metal ore)</li>
</ul>

<li>Play mini-games (win the Big Wallet in the chest game)</li>
<li>Relic Collector's House contains a bottle and the Ocarina of Wind.</li>
<li>Visit the castle and meet the Council of Elders - including Zelda. Cutscene where the Dark Tribe storms the castle.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Kakariko City
<ul>
<li>Alchemist's Alehouse (Tavern) - the owner will discuss with you the importance of Alchemy Stones, but only if you become friends with him first. Talk to him often, during both day and night.</li>
<li>Inn - sleep here for 20 rupees and turn day into night (or vice versa). Different time of day will change what some character do or say, mostly just in Kakariko for the moment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Goron City
<ul>
<li>A sickness spreading through the Goron population led them to build a great moutaintop Mausoleum a few years ago. An old Goron named Dampeh tended to it until an evil spirit took it over. Now Dampeh guards the Mausoleum, preventing people from going inside.</li>
<li>A Goron family is holed up in their house. The father is distraught because his son is sick and he can't do anything for him. He asks you to go find the doctor. The doctor can be found in another house by asking the other townsfolk (along the way you happen upon the Mountaintop Mausoleum, but Dampeh won't let you enter). When the doctor arrives, he tries to help the kid, but he ends up dying anyway. Later that night, the kid's ghost is seen floating toward the mausoleum where he leads you inside.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="#dungeon4">Death Mountain - Mountaintop Mausoleum (4th) - Fire/Shadow themes</a>
<ul>
<li>With the evil gone from the Mausoleum, the sick gorons slowly start getting better. If you return to Goron City later, part of the former mausoleum will even be converted back into a mine!</li>
<li>Talking to most anyone in Ordon or Castle Town will direct you to the lumberjack living in Faron Woods. If you talk to him, he'll mention how he's heard stories of treasures being hidden BENEATH Lake Hylia. He's seen grates nearby, but he has no idea how you would go about draining a whole lake!</li>
<li>Anyone you talk to in Kakariko will mention that the grates seen around Hyrule indicate a branch of the great Hyrule Sewers nearby. Sometimes you can even alter the land above from the sewers below!</li>
<li>To progress, you must return to the sewers and find the western-central branch (located near Lake Hylia, directly below Hyrule Castle). Flip a large switch to drain a large part of Lake Hylia above, and find the entrance to the Lakebed Lair (and the Big Key, which leads to the boomerang in the sewers, after defeating a Big Poe) in the process.</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<a name="dungeon2"></a>
<ul>

<li>Miniboss: Lanmola</li>
<li>Item: Bracelet</li>
<li>Boss: Manhandla</li>
<li>Reward: Book of Mudora page</li>
<li>Notes: Pyramid theme lends to there being Gibdos EVERWHERE! Also remnants of the mining facility means a lot of conveyor belts and plenty of boxes to move.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<a name="dungeon4"></a>
<ul>
<li><strong>Death Mountain - Mountaintop Mausoleum (4th) - Fire/Shadow themes</strong>

<li>Reward: Book of Mudora page</li>
<li>Notes: Combination of shadow and fire themes has never been done before!

Upon the destruction of the ultimate spirit, the Vire Sorceror, the entire mausoleum is illuminated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<li>Item: Hookshot</li>
<li>Boss: Plasmarine</li>

<li>Notes: Since the Lake has been drained, this is a non-traditional water dungeon. Only one or two water rooms in the beginning, several rooms consist of quicksand (running with pegasus boots or hookshotting past pits will be used). Later rooms require manipulating blocking water streams and other mechanics. Water will be returned to the lake after temple is complete, which means that several rooms in the dungeon will be drained - if Link can get back in, he might find more treasure!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<a name="dungeon6"></a>
<ul>
<li><strong>Snowpeak - Snowpeak Caverns (6th) - Ice/Spirit themes</strong>

<li>Item: Cane of Somaria</li>
<li>Boss: Stalfos Knight</li>
<li>Reward: Book of Mudora (unenchanted)</li>
<li>Notes: Fairly normal ice dungeon, with some dark/spirit elements thrown in (Wallmasters?). Combination of hard hat beetles and holes make this dungeon difficult. The Cane of Somaria will be used to fill special pits and allow Link to continue. Star switches will move the position of other holes to let Link proceed. One large hole will need to be fallen into in order to access the basement floor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Septen Heights - Tower of the Winds (7th) - Wind/Seasonal themes</strong>

<li>Minibosses: Ice Keese Swarm, Fire Keese Swarm, Grim Creeper</li>
<li>Item: Light Shield</li>
<li>Boss: Helmaroc/Kargaroc</li>
<li>Reward: Book of Mudora (enchanted, complete)</li>
<li>Notes: Each level of the tower houses a different type of weather/wind. Puzzles in each level will depend on the type of weather and may depend on elemental items (lamp for fire, cane for ice, etc). Light shield used heavily (redirect ice blasts/beams, use light beams to make plants grow, absorb heat and send it out at ice, block wind gusts)</li>
<li>NB: The last two unique combinations not used in this tower are saved for the last dungeon (Electric/Earth - Light Storms, Electric - Heavy Storms)
<ul>
<li>Floor 1 (NW): Light Breezes (Earth)</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<a name="dungeon8"></a>
<ul>
<li><strong>Forest of Light/Lost Woods - Interloper Sanctum (8th) - Shadow theme</strong>
<ul>
<li>Miniboss: Dark Link</li>
<li>Item: Light Arrows</li>
<li>Boss: Belahim (Dark Tribe Leader)</li>
<li>Notes: Large two-story palace. The top (entry) story will be almost completely dark, with very few lamps, so you must proceed almost blind. Few puzzles, but lots of enemies! The nearly last room will house a mini-boss fight with Dark Link. The bottom story will play like a game of Pente/Othello/Go, where each room can be switched to either light or dark by lamp-lighting puzzles, mirror shield reflection puzzles, Light Arrows, or some other dynamic. You win the game by lighting up five rooms in a row without Dark Link extinguishing them (playing board is the map), you can proceed to Belahim. As an added bonus, each room pays homage to various dungeons!</li>
