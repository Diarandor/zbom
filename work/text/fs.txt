HOW I MADE THIS TEXT DUMP/Come ho fatto per trovare questi testi [COME]
It's very simple!!!
I just opened the ROM with a Text Editor (WordPad) and I scrolled down 
searching some text (it's very long).
Near the end I found that some words started to have a meaning... so I 
started copying them on another file.
Then I removed the other languages (Spanish, German, French) and pasted them 
here.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


è molto facile!!!
Ho soltanto aperto la ROM con un programma di elaborazione testi (WordPad) E 
sono andato verso il fondo a cercare del testo (è molto lungo).
Verso la fine ho visto che le parole cominciavano ad avere un significato e 
ho cominciato a copiarlo su un altro file.
Poi ho rimosso le alter lingue (Spagnolo, Tedesco e Francese) e li ho 
incollati qui.

"LINK"We have arrived.
 

That is the sacred blade I spoke of,
the Four Sword. Sealed away in its
forged steel is Vaati, the wind mage.
Lately I have been sensing weakness
in the seal. It worries me.
That is why we have come here...Be careful.
It is said that the body of one who
touches this blade will be shattered 
to pieces. It has mysterious powers...
Legends say that when mighty Vaati
attacked, a hero arose and saved the 
people from destruction. They go on to
say that by using this sword, the one 
was as four, and the four combined
their strength! Let's check the seal...
Step back a moment. Hoh hoh hoh hoh! Have you some
business with me? 
-
So, you noticed that the seal was
weakening? 
How rude! Release me!
Eh?
 

I sensed a great power approaching,
so I hid myself. 
But my, what a lovely catch! Surely
you must be some noble maiden. 
My name is Vaati. I am the great wind
mage! The seal is broken... 
so I shall rage yet again!
Hoh hoh hoh! And what a gift awaits my
return! I shall make you my bride! 
Onward we go, to my palace of winds!
Hoh hoh hoh!
EEEEEEK! Help me! 

Open your eyes... Young hero... The Princess Zelda has been carried
off to Vaati's Palace. 
Hurry! You must go to her... But you cannot go alone... You have need of the 
Four Sword... Draw out the blade... No matter how mighty the enemy, with
the power of four, you can defeat it... The Great Fairies ahead know the path
to his palace... If the Great Fairies acknowledge your
abilities, they will show you the way. If you are able to gather many Rupees
along the path to the Great Fairies, 
they will likely acknowledge your
courage... Please rescue the princess...		
 
You will find many traps and puzzles
in the areas ahead.
We will give you advice that will aid you
in your quest. Do not fail to heed it.
When each of you stands on a red warp
zone, all will be transported to
another floor, where you will learn
about many items.
Begin by standing on the warp zones'
ahead. The one below will take you
back to the map.

Your Rupees are counted in
the bottom-right corner of your
screen. The Rupees each of you
gather are pooled in a single wallet
for all. If one of you fails in your
quest, he can be revived for
50 Rupees. But the cost for revival will
increase each time one of you fails...
And while there is one wallet, your
individual efforts are being watched
by us fairies. And your efforts shall
certainly be rewarded.
He who gathers the most Rupees will be
acknowledged as the greatest hero.

You can then make your way there to

Onward, little hero eggs!

Vaati's palace of winds is a great

You can now choose the path to 
Vaati's Palace. 
That path will likely be much more
dangerous than any you've seen yet. 
And yet onward you must go,
great heroes!
the Great Fairies of Forest, Ice, and 
Flame, a path to Vaati's Palace
shall open. 
Onward, great heroes!
the three Hero's Keys. 
You should now be able to choose the
path to Vaati's Palace. 
It is a path of twelve levels, all more
dangerous than those you've seen. 
Yet onward you must go, great heroes!
Rupees. But you must strive to reach 
greater heights. Show us your courage
by gathering more Rupees! 
Only then shall we dub you to be the
greatest of heroes, and only then 
shall I grant you the Key' that opens a
harder path. May we meet again!

You should already be able
to open the way to Vaati's Palace.
It is a dangerous place
with 12 levels. 
So, onward, brave heroes!
 
Gwoh hoh hoh hoh hoh hoh!
 
Welcome to my palace!
I never thought you would be so bold
as to pursue the maiden, Zelda, until 
you stood before me. Eh? What's that?
That blade you have... 
Is that not the accursed Four Sword?
So it is the power of that blade that
has brought you this far... 
Hoh hoh hoh hoh hoh!
Did you think a dull and rusty blade
such as that could defeat me again? 
You know not your own folly! Watch now
as the hunted becomes the hunter! 
Gwoh hoh hoh hoh hoh hoh hoh!
 
Prepare to meet the full might of Vaati
the wind mage! Gwohhhhh-ohhhhh-hohhhhh! Did you
think you could just leave? Fools!!! 
Impertinent brats! I'll shatter the Four
Sword and cast its pieces to the wind!
Gwohhhhhhhhhhh... I've been felled
by a bunch of young kids?!  
My b-body! My being! I'm being sucked
into the Four Sword!Gwohhhhhhhhhh... Uhhhnnn... 
Oh! You saved me, didn't you?
Thank you! 
But this time, something seems
different...Why!? There are X of you! So the
legend of the Four Sword was true!
But how can we get you back to
normal? The Four Sword is the only blade that
can contain the wind mage.
Since you have fulfilled that destiny,
the sword's power over you will fade.
Now, let us return!
And let us return the Four Sword
to its shrine once again.

(THE END)

Italian Coming soon!
