--------------------
What is a text dump?
--------------------
A text dump contains all the text in a video game, ripped
straight from the ROM. I use a script to convert the ROM code
into formatted, readable text, in either TXT or HTML format.
Why is this useful? It is often useful, when theorizing about
Zelda, to have exact quotes handy. These text dumps put all
the text in the Zelda games at one's fingertips.

A word of warning though: internally, the ROMs arrange the
quotes in essentially random order. There is a little bit of
structure: for example, though one person's dialogue may be
split up into separate quotes, these quotes will generally
be all together, in order. But if you wish to find a specific
quote from the game, you will have to already know a few words
from the quote so that you can search through the entire text
dump. Any decent text editor should have a Search function,
and you'll need to use it to find anything specific in the
text dumps.


------------------------------------------------------
Where can I get the latest version of your text dumps?
------------------------------------------------------
If you downloaded this file off of a site like GameFAQs.com,
you might have an out-of-date version. This is because I only
submitted the text dumps to FAQ sites once, just so people
would know that these text dumps exist. Updated versions can
be obtained at this web site (Zeldalegends -
http://www.zeldalegends.net) in the Emulation section.
Compare the revision date at the top of this document with
the one in the files on my site to see if you have the latest
version.


---------------------------
How do you make text dumps?
---------------------------
I include the following information for those who are curious.
If you don't understand any of it, just skip ahead.

The first step in making a text dump is to have a copy of the
ROM. Then, if you have a quote from the game, you can search
for the text. Newer games (like OoT, MM, and LA) use standard
ASCII values for raw text, so it is possible to find the text
using any common text editor. Older games (like LoZ, AoL, and
ALttP), unfortunately, don't use ASCII standards, so it's
necessary to do a relative search using a hex editor like
Thingy. Then you can make a translation table that will allow
Thingy to translate ROM text into standard ASCII text. (There
are many freeware utilities available that will help you do
relative searches and make translation tables.)

To make things even more difficult, some games compress, or
encrypt, the text. For example, in Oracle of Seasons the hex
value "02 0E" translates to "Twinrova." ALttP uses compression
and doesn't use standard ASCII values, so this is the most
difficult game to dump. OoS and OoA use ASCII standards but
have text compression. Fortunately, I already have TBL files
for both of these games, so dumping is not as difficult as it
could have been. ^_^

After you have found the text (and you're sure you've found
ALL the text), copy and paste all the text you can find into
a new file. This is what the DMP files on my site are: all the
text I could find, copied and pasted straight out of the ROM.
Once this is done, I wrote a PHP script to parse the DMP file
and translate everything into a readable format (TXT or HTML).
Making a program is the easiest thing to do in the long run
(though something more powerful than PHP is usually preferable),
because it takes a while to find out what all the codes in the
ROM translate to. Using the standard Find/Replace function of
a text editor is too much work if what you're searching for
constantly changes.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Notes:
 -All the text in the game is here with the exception of
  the dialogues on the Tingle Tuner. I was unable to track
  these down and I think that it will be very difficult to
  retrieve those.
 -There are a few [?] marks which are the some control values
  which are unknown to me.

  I've been trying real hard ever since then,

  I just can't seem to hit 22 letters!
  I doubt I'll ever be as good as you, man.
  So anyway, I've been hearing all kinds of
  crazy tales about you, and I figured I
  just had to write you a letter.

  It sounds like you're doing some pretty
  amazing stuff, man! You're great!
  You're awesome! You're...the man, man!

  You can probably tell that I had no idea
  what to write, but hey, I figured the
  least I could do would be to send you
  a letter of encouragement.
  So... Yay, man, yay!
  Go, man, go! Go! Go!
  Never give up! Never lose hope!

  And while I don't make much, I'm sending
  you the wages I've earned lately. Just
  doing my part! Hope it helps!

  I'm really sorry I had to send this C.O.D.,
  but I guess that's the price of fame!

It would seem that the wind god Cyclos

Have you noticed, [player_name]? Morning
has not broken since we arrived at
Greatfish Isle_the land that was so ravaged
by monsters. It is as if time itself is frozen.

pirates overtaking us.

In fact, it might not be a bad idea for you
to visit your hometown and family again
after such a long time away.

We can speak with Jabun after you do.

At last, I have succeeded in stealing the
Picto Box I have desired for so long.
Succeeded, yes...but sadly...
Due to a slight mistake on my part, I was
also caught. I have been imprisoned, but
I do not give in easily! I refuse to
give this wondrous box to my captors!
I have decided to hide it here in the
depths of my cell and then make my
escape by tunneling out. Yes! That is
my plan!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Of course, if I ever successfully escape from
this prison, I shall one day return to recover
the Picto Box. I will write the controls
for it in case I should forget them...
Set it to [Y], [Z], or [X] on the Items 
screen. Press [A] to snap shots. Use [C] to
zoom in and out. Press [R] to switch to its

Your sword landed all the way up there?
Shoot! I'm sorry! I apologize! I guess my aim

Heh heh... The look on your face... Priceless!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Come on! What are you doing?!



If you start wandering around a place as
well-guarded as that without any means of
defense, you're bound to get caught!

At the very least, you should see if there's
anything nearby that you can use to hide
yourself with! Think stealth!

See what you can find around there, and be
quick about it! Time is short!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Are you planning on spending the rest of
your life in there?!


Look around! I'd be surprised if a run-down

you could use to worm your way out!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ah-hah! I've got it, [player_name]!



In order to reach the top of the tower where
your sister's being held, you'll have to find
the room right below the tower. The path to
the tower begins in the rear of that room!
You got that?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Those searchlights are a real pain, huh?



You're going to have to deal with them
somehow, I'm afraid...


There's got to be a way to get up to where
those searchlights are. Look around and see
what you can find, OK?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Listen up, [player_name]...
There's a monster running the searchlight
up there!

If you can slay the monster, then just
maybe it'll shut the searchlight down.


Oh...but you're unarmed, aren't you?
All you have is a shield... 


If I were you, I'd try to use my shield to
deflect the monster's blows and see if I
could make it drop its weapon. If you did
that, you could pick up its weapon with [A].
...But that's just me. What'll you do?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What's the matter!? The room your sister's
in is just up ahead...


Look carefully at the tower wall. Isn't there
a narrow ledge you can cross?

Face the wall and press [A] to sidle along
the wall. You should be able to get across
the ledge...as long as you're careful.

Just remember, you can't do anything else
while you're sidling, so you have to be
extra-careful of what's around you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Heh heh... I slipped this stone into your
pocket just before we fired you over there.
It's no ordinary stone, either.

I can see what you're doing through this
stone, and obviously you can hear me
through it. So...if you see [flashing icon],
you'd better press that button!
I've put the stone on your Quest Status
screen. Press START and use [L] or [R] to
scroll around. It's pretty basic.

Hey, but listen carefully! I need this back
after you save your sister, so don't go
losing it, you understand?!

All right, [player_name]...
I'll need you to listen to me for a moment.


The item you seek is hidden somewhere in
this castle. To find it, you must find the
entrance to the basement.

But...that entrance has been blocked by a
mighty threshold, firmly sealed to prevent
evil from ever gaining access.

Do you know where to search and what you
must do to open the hidden way?


You will find a clue in the shape of the
herald near where we arrived at the castle.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Excellent, [player_name]. To perceive such
a puzzle and decipher it is no small feat.


Now, take the sword that lies before you.



It is none other than the Master Sword...
The blade of evil's bane.


It is the only sword that can banish
Ganon from the world above!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name]! We must return to the

Long ago, there existed a kingdom where
a golden power lay hidden.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It was a prosperous land blessed with green
forests, tall mountains, and peace.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But one day a man of great evil found the
golden power and took it for himself...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
With its strength at his command, he
spread darkness across the kingdom.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But then, when all hope had died, and the
hour of doom seemed at hand...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...a young boy clothed in green appeared
as if from nowhere.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Wielding the blade of evil's bane, he sealed
the dark one away and gave the land light.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
This boy, who traveled through time to save
the land, was known as the Hero of Time.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The boy's tale was passed down through
generations until it became legend...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But then...a day came when a fell wind
began to blow across the kingdom.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The great evil that all thought had
been forever sealed away by the hero...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...once again crept forth from the depths of
the earth, eager to resume its dark designs.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The people believed that the Hero of Time
would again come to save them.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...But the hero did not appear.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Faced by an onslaught of evil, the people
could do nothing but appeal to the gods.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
In their last hour, as doom drew nigh, they
left their future in the hands of fate.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What became of that kingdom...?
None remain who know.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

The memory of the kingdom vanished, but
its legend survived on the wind's breath.

to find heroic blades and cast down evil.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

know courage like the hero of legend...

The sail will catch the wind, which will

Use [+] to steer. If you wish to move
quickly, you should keep the wind blowing
directly into the sail. You can always
press [A] to put away the sail.
Try it when you want to adjust your speed.

You must go see this dragon and request
from him a jewel called Din's Pearl.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ask the people of the Rito tribe who inhabit
this island about how to see the dragon.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, I almost forgot! Wait just a moment!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
This island has been a calm and peaceful
place for as long as I have known it.


What could have happened to it?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ask the winged Rito tribespeople about the
sky spirit, Valoo.


We cannot set sail again until you have
the pearl.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It would seem that Ganon sent those
monsters to this place.


But that would mean...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
There is no time to lose! We must depart at
once for the place where the next pearl
sleeps! We sail to the south!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The wind is blowing to the south! Quickly!
Swim beside me and press [A] to climb
aboard! We must depart at once for the
place where the next pearl lies sleeping!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...Unfortunately, we cannot depart until the
wind blows to the south.


It would be a fatal mistake to set sail
under an unstable breeze.


I have heard legends that tell of a wind god
who once resided on this island...

Have you heard nothing of him?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yes! Do you not see what rises up from
the horizon?


That is where you must go, [player_name]...
the Forest Haven.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It may appear as though this is but a great
tree rising far above the ocean's surface...


But it is a sacred place. It is inside this
grotto that you will find the spirit of the
earth, the Great Deku Tree.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You must speak with the Deku Tree and
receive from him the sacred gem known as
Farore's Pearl.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I fear that Ganon's vile hand may have
already reached this most sacred of
sanctuaries.

Go forth with caution, [player_name].
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Around the Forest Haven there were once
many lush islands that were home to
throngs of forest fairies...

When did this place become so barren
and sad?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Could those withered islands be...



[player_name]! You must hurry to the Deku
Tree and ask him for his sacred pearl!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So this place, too, has been attacked by
Ganon. Could he already be regaining
his power?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name], you must get the remaining
pearl! It lies in a place northwest of here.


We must set sail immediately!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What are you doing?



I have marked our next destination on your
Sea Chart.


We have no time to delay here!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You can change the direction of the wind
from aboard my deck.


If you get lost out on the sea, just check
your Sea Chart and change the wind so it
blows toward your destination.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Look, [player_name]! Do you see it?



...What has happened to this place?



.............
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Wh-What is the meaning of this?
The island... It is...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...We are too late.



I knew we had precious little time, but I
never suspected how little...


A great water spirit named Jabun once lived
here, but no sign of him remains...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ho, there! [player_name]!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So, you're here! I've been looking for you!



Are you by chance seeking the great
spirit, Jabun?


I'm sorry to report to you that Jabun can
no longer be found here.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Just look at how this place has been torn
to pieces... I suppose this, too, is the work
of the shadow in Forsaken Fortress.

But fear not! Jabun was able to flee this
island before it was attacked. He is in a
safer abode now.

Would you like to guess where that abode
may be?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...On the island where you were born.


On Outset.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yet even if you were to go to Outset now,
you would not be able to see Jabun.


The cave where he hides is sealed with a
mighty stone slab that repels all who try
to pass it. Why, not even the pirates with
their mighty ship could get in...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...I must apologize, [player_name].
I thought if anyone would know of your
whereabouts, it would be the pirates.

I told them this tale without so much as
a thought for the consequences.


I don't know what they hoped to get, but
they immediately set sail for Outset Island
and tried to break into the cave.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...It is lucky they could not gain entrance.
I have heard that they were last spotted
on Windfall Island, but doing what, I do
not know.
If you wish to see Jabun, I think you'd
better search for the pirates on Windfall
Island.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What an eerie isle this is... Everywhere else
boasts clear skies and calm seas, but this
place suffers under dark clouds and rain.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Valoo must have been right when he asked
me to bring word of Jabun to you...


He called this island cursed...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I would counsel against staying here
longer than you have to.


...But that is your decision. I have told you
of Jabun, so my task is complete!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So, Jabun has survived!



The sea spirit has lived through the trials
of many long years. He must have caught
wind of Ganon's attack beforehand...

If we are to believe the words of the Rito
postman, then the pirates know something
about the cave where Jabun hides.

Why don't we go first to Windfall and
search for them there?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What is the matter? Have you forgotten
where Windfall Island lies?


If you have, then check your Sea Chart.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It is too soon for us to venture in this
direction. We should sail directly to our
next destination.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Beyond here is outside the bounds of the
course. We must not stray out-of-bounds!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name]...
You must remember well the appearance
of this room.

The shape of the floor... The number of
items hanging on the walls...
Such things are the keys to solving the
riddles that lie ahead.
Do not overlook anything!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I've been waiting for you, [player_name].



[player_name]...
Try these on.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Time certainly flies... I can't believe you're
already old enough to wear these clothes.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Don't look so disappointed, dear one!
Just try them on.


Today is a day to celebrate! It is the day
that you become the same age as the young
hero spoken of in all the legends.

You only have to wear them for one day, so
don't look so down. Be proud, child!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
In the olden days, this was the day boys
were finally considered to be men. They
were taught the ways of the sword to
prepare them for battle with their enemies.

________________________________________
Hanging the family shield on the wall as

________________________________________
Does all this make sense to you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Isn't that nice, [player_name]? They suit
you perfectly! A perfect fit!


Well, tonight I'm going to invite the whole
town over for your birthday party, so I'd
better start getting ready, shouldn't I?

Your grandma is going to make your
favorite soup for you tonight! Mmmm!


I just know you're looking forward to it!



Now, go get your sister, Aryll.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What is it, [player_name]?



Go call Aryll for me!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But we don't live in such an age any
longer... Our ways are the ways of peace.


Nowadays, I suppose Orca is the only one
on the island who still knows anything
about swordplay.

I think you need a new look...

Hoo hoo hoooooooooo! If my appearance
does not surprise you...
Then you, sir, must be a fairy, just
like Tingle!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Blue clothes...and a crawfish design?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I've been waiting for you, [player_name].



Here you are, [player_name].
Try these on!


These are special clothes...made of a
special fabric that only the honest can see!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What's the matter? Why the long face?
You CAN see them, can't you? Hm hm hm...


Well, today is the day we commemorate
the fact that you've reached the same age
as the hero of the legends! You have to be
proud about that for at least one day!
Put them on and see if you can't fool
anybody in town!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Wow! You really DO have blue clothes...
with a picture of a crawfish on them!


You're [player_name], right?

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I wouldn't be surprised if she's climbed up
to her favorite spot to play with the gulls
again today.

I've always thought it quite odd...
She's the only person I know who the wild
gulls will even approach.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

With the power you have now, you can

Tell Grandma what's troubling you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
And where's Aryll...? Is she still
playing outside with the gulls?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ohhh... Uhnnn...




[player_name]... Aryll...
Don't go... Don't leave... Uhhnnn...
Don't leave your poor old grandma...
...all alone... Uhnnn... Uhhhnnn...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Ohh, [player_name]? Is that you, 
[player_name]?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

[player_name]... My dear, sweet

You're safe... That's wonderful...
Just wonderful.


Did you do this? Did you heal me?
Oh, you're such a sweet child...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ohh... That's right...



You and your sister, Aryll, are trying so
hard to be strong, and I've just been
sitting here, moaning and worrying...

I'm your grandmother... I'm the one who
should be taking care of you...


I'm so sorry, [player_name]. I haven't even
considered what you must be going
through. I'm a terrible grandma...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name], this is all I have to give

If you run out of Grandma's homemade
soup, then you just come see me. I can

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Aren't you hungry? Would you like Grandma

Yes, please
No, thank you

________________________________________
You are such a well-mannered child!
But you do know you can ask me for
some whenever you like, don't you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Whenever you have an empty bottle, you
just bring it straight to Grandma.
I can make more soup for you whenever
you like!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Taking this out here won't do anything...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, [player_name]! Happy birthday!



Hey, did your sister, Aryll, find you?
She was supposed to tell you that your
grandmother is looking for you.

Speaking of your sister, she saw me at work
the other day, and she said she wanted to
learn to carry jars on her head like me so
she could help your grandma with chores.
So...if you see her, tell her that all
she has to do is stand in front of a jar
and press [A] to carry it. To put the
jar down, she just has to press [R]!
Can you tell her that for me?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The secret to lifting jars is to stand in
front of them and press [A].
And don't forget to tell Aryll to set
jars down with [R], OK?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What was that noise!? It was awful!
You'd better return home quickly...
A sound like that can only mean trouble!

You know what I'd do if trouble came my
way? I'd throw rocks to fight it off!
You could handle that, couldn't you?

It's easy! Just stand in front of a rock and
press [A] to lift it. Press [A] again to throw
it. If you just want to set the rock back
down, press [R].
Do you understand?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
To lift a rock, stand in front of it and
press [A]. When you want to throw, press
[A] again. Press [R] to set it down.
Couldn't be easier!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name], I thought I heard Aryll's
voice cry from far away...
Is it... Is it really true?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What kind of weird boat is that?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...That's just terrible! My precious jars...
How could you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
That's just awful...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, that was fine...
It won't do. It won't do.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, that's right!
I knew I forgot something.
Yes, I'd better head back.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Is... Is that you, [player_name]?



Well, looks as though you're safe...
That's good to know.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Your grandmother has been having a
terrible time of it ever since you left.


She rarely leaves the house, and as far as I
can tell, she just spends her days sleeping.
She hardly eats...

I've actually come here to see if my old
grandpa knows of any medicine or anything
that might make her feel better.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The island has really taken a turn for the
worse since you left.


I'm sure you noticed them... The monsters...
Those horrible creatures... They rampage
through town every night after dark.

I'm scared... Too scared...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ever since you left, our lovely island has
become a horrible place to live. 


Every night now, when the sun disappears,
vile monsters appear and tear across the
island, causing havoc.

It's frightening... So frightening...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Your poor old grandmother...
Her days are spent in worry, and her nights
are filled with horrific nightmares...

I've tried to give her medicine to help
her feel better, but she just can't seem
to drink it...

I don't know what to do...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name]? Are you all right?



Our island is a dangerous place now.
You shouldn't stay outside long!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Monsters have begun appearing in town at
night. It's awful out there! You really
should go home while you can. Who else is
going to protect your grandmother?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, [player_name].



Hey, congrats! I'm really looking forward
to tonight, buddy! We're gonna party!


But...are you really that old already?
Wow! Time just flies right by, huh?!
It never ceases to amaze me.

I mean, for example, I swear I just cut the
grass in this field the other day, but look
at how tall it's gotten! Ah, well...
The mysteries of time and grass...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Say, do you want to try cutting it, too,
[player_name]? You'd be surprised at the
things people drop in the grass. It's
like hunting for treasure!
Except... Without some kind of grass-cutting
tool, you can't cut the grass. Sorry, buddy.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I can't just let this field be, you know.
If I did, the weeds would take control!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Cutting grass is hard work, but it pays off!
People leave the darnedest things in the
grass, so if you go to the trouble of cutting
it, you get to keep whatever you find.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Did you hear that noise, [player_name]?
Did something happen? What was it?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, say! That's a fine sword you have
there, buddy! Just look at that thing!


You know, you'd be doing me a big favor
if you'd cut this here grass for me.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Sometimes you can find things in the
grass when you cut it, so it isn't always a
thankless chore! It pays, buddy!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Eh? [player_name]? Is that you,
[player_name]? Whoa.


You kind of startled me there, buddy. I
thought more of those monsters had come
to harass me.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I tell you, there have been a lot of strange
things going on here at night lately. I
haven't gotten a good night's sleep in ages
because of it! And I love sleep!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
In fact, I saw something really odd just a
little while ago. Of course, this was back
before the bridge was destroyed...

It was up in the Fairy Woods, near the old
dried-up fountain. I saw this tall girl who
glowed like a fairy, which was odd enough,
but then she vanished into that rock...
Really! I saw it with my own eyes!

There have been strange things going on at
night, I tell you! It's turned my whole
schedule upside-down. Now I'm up all night
and asleep in bed all day...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Awww... I just want to cut the grass...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I wonder what that was all about...
That fairy-looking girl I saw up there
by the big stone...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name]! Is that you? If I recall
correctly, today, you are the same age as
the legendary hero.

When did you get so old?



You must build strong muscles from now on!
Strong muscles!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You have come at the perfect moment!
I was just trying my rolling attack.
Allow me to teach it to you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Are you ready? Just run as fast as you
can, then press [A]. That is how you
perform a rolling attack.

If you think you understand, then try to roll
into the wall. Go on, young one!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Did you hear me, [player_name]? Run as
fast as you can and press [A] to perform
a rolling attack. Try rolling into the wall.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh! What is the matter, [player_name]?
You have an urgent look about you...
Has something happened?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Whatever it is, from the look on your face
I suspect it is no laughing matter...

What say you, [player_name]?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Do you wish to practice your skills with
the sword?
Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Do not begrudge the effort required to
build strength. If you change your mind,
come see me. I will be happy to train you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Very good! Your first lesson shall be the
horizontal slice!
Face me and press [B]. Do not fear for my
safety... I am ready for you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Very good. Next is the vertical slice!
Hold [L] to target me, then press [B]!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Very good! Next is the thrust!
[L]-target, then tilt [+] [v] and press [B].
Come at me! Thrust with your sword!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Very good! Now finally, the jump attack!
Draw your sword, [L]-target, and press [A]!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
That was a fine display!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You still have much to learn, but the skill
to become a master is in your veins. Do not
neglect your practice!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Wrong! Press only [B]!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[L]-target and press [B] to perform a
vertical slice!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You thrust by [L]-targeting, tilting
[+] [v], and pressing [B].
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You must perform a jump attack! Draw your
blade, [L]-target, and press [A].
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What say you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Such a racket! Can't you keep quiet!?
You've knocked everything off my
shelves, you dratted hooligan!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ah! My brother upstairs is very high-strung.
His is the way of knowledge. He locks
himself in his room and studies all day.

He is quite wise, but with that big head of
his, he is hardly...accommodating.


On top of it all, he is so very feeble! At
times, I am ashamed to call him my brother.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But enough of that, [player_name]! I sense
the natural talent that beats in your veins.


But you need more than talent to make it
in the world today. You must also be bold!
And to that end, I shall teach you the art
of swordplay.
What say you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I am sure you can master the sword quickly,
as well!

What say you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
From now on, [player_name], you must
train your body constantly!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Press [A] while running to do a
rolling attack! [L]-target and press [A] while
tilting [+] [<] or [>] to jump.

Ah, yes! And remember, to do a back-flip,
just tilt [+] [^] and press [A].
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You should practice daily from now on.



By the way, [player_name], might you be
interested in learning the art of fencing?

What say you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Press [A] while running to perform a
rolling attack. [L]-target and press [A] while
tilting [+] [<] or [>] to jump.

Tilt [+] [^] and press [A] to do a back-flip.
Do not forget these things.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Good! ...Keep coming at me until you hear
me say "Very good!"
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Keep swinging!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Very good! Keep thrusting!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Next is the spin attack! Hold [B] briefly to
build up your strength, then release it!
(Or rotate [+] once and press [B].)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hold [B] briefly and release it to do a
spin attack! (Or rotate [+] once and tap [B].)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Very good! More! Keep it up!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Come at me once more!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Next is harder! This is a parry attack.
[L]-target until you see [flashing icon], then quickly
press [A] to perform a defensive strike!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Very good! And again! [L]-target and watch
closely for [flashing icon]!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
No! You can only perform a parry by
[L]-targeting and pressing [A] when
you see the [flashing icon]!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ah? [player_name]? You are all right!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Why did you not tell me about Aryll?
That was thoughtless of you...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
This island has seen hard times ever
since you departed...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hmm... I do not know what you have been
doing on your journey, but you seem a little
more daring these days.

That look in your eye is not the one you
left here with.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Very good! Show me just how much you've
improved your sword skills!
OK
Not now
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If I must say so, your skills with the
sword are still at the level of a page!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Very good! Try to hit me 100 times or more
before I hit you three times!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Very good, knight!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Now, try to hit me 300 times before I hit
you three times!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You are still at the level of swordsman
when it comes to your sword skills.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If you want to be a true master, you
must hit me 500 times before I hit you
three times!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Are you happy just being a swordsman?
Surely you can do better than that!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Keep coming at me until I hit you
three times!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Do not hold back, Master [player_name].
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Come at me as if I were your fiercest enemy!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
This is all I can do for you, I am afraid!
Of course, I will always be happy to face
off against you...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Enough!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You couldn't pierce my defenses even once...
What a poor showing. You must remember...
As you grow stronger in your skills,
others may grow stronger as well!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You may come here to practice as often as
you like. I will always be happy to face off
against you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[?], eh...?
Remember, though you may grow in
strength, others grow stronger as well!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ah! [?]! You have improved!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I guess it was wrong of me to treat you
like you were still a lowly page.
You are a page no more!

Now you are a knight!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Knight! It is not much, but it is now
yours! Take this with you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It was wrong of me to treat you like a
child. From now on, you have my respect.


I shall call you swordsman!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Swordsman! You will likely need something
like this in your travels... Take it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You have already become a fine swordsman.
But I am certain you can do even better!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name], take this!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Impressive, [player_name]! I lost count of
how many times you struck me!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You have learned all I have to teach,
Master [player_name]!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Master! It is not much to speak of, but
please, take this.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ah. How...pleasant. My arm feels numb.



Master, is your left index finger not numb,
as well?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Master! Please, take this.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ah. How...pleasant. My arm feels numb.


Master, is your left index finger not numb?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Impressive, Master [player_name]!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
This is thanks for giving me a good lesson!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I have learned much.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ah. We have not met for some time.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Do you wish to fight me again?
What say you, [player_name]?
Sure
No thanks
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It has been some time since I last saw you,
Master.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Shall we, [player_name]?
Sure
No thanks
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Wh-Why, that is...a Knight's Crest!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
How many of those do you have?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hmph!



Then I suppose the time has come for me to
speak to you about the crests...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The Knight's Crest...
It is the symbol of a courageous knight...


But not just anyone can gather them...
No! It takes a soul who possesses not only
power, but wisdom and courage as well!

Any courageous soul who gathers ten of
these crests can learn a powerful new
sword technique!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Both my brother and I dreamt of learning
this technique in our youth. We worked so
hard to collect the crests...

But it took many long years and adventures
beyond count before we even approached
finding ten of them, and we both grew old...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It appears you have enough might to learn
that technique now.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Perhaps, just perhaps, you can master it!



Very good, [player_name]!
Heed my words!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hold [B] to build up power, then release it!
Come at me, now! Do it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hold [B] to build up your power! Then
release it! Heed me! Try it again!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name]! Where are you going!?
Hold [B] to build up your power,
then release it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Amazing, [player_name]! You did it! You
have mastered the Hurricane Spin!



At last, you have made our long-held dream
come true!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, the joyful tears... They won't stop...



I thought my tears had dried up long ago.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
There is nothing left for me to teach you!



I am certain now that you will save your
sister, Aryll, and bring her home to Outset!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...



Come see me once you have collected ten of
the Knight's Crests!
Then I can teach you what they are for!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I have nothing left to teach you!



I am certain you will save your sister,
Aryll, and return with her to Outset!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
'Hoy! [player_name]! Press [L] right there
and use [A] to talk to me! Try it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
That's correct. You're a smart one!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You, my friend, have just [L]-targeted me.
You see, when you press [L], you can target
certain objects. I, for one, use it quite often
to talk to folks who are far away from me.
Of course, even if there isn't anything
around to target, you can press [L] to face
forward, you know. It's quite handy, indeed.

There are a myriad of other ways to use
[L]-targeting, as well. Quite an ingenious
little thing, if I do say so myself!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Of course, that's not the only trick in my
bag. Not remotely! I can teach you a few
more things if you'll just climb up that
ladder over there and drop by my room.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
That [L]-targeting you just did has a
wide range of uses, my boy! Most certainly!


For instance, you can use it to talk to
far-off people, or if there isn't anyone to
target, you can use it to face forward
quickly. It's quite ingenious, I should say!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If you desire the benefits of my wisdom, I
can teach you many other things. Just climb
up that ladder over there and come see me
in my room for some expert tutelage.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You're growing up, [player_name], which
means you're going to need as much wisdom
as you can get from this point forward!

And if you want to be wise, you must first
know things! 


Now, I was born before you, so I know all
sorts of things. Yes, I've been studying
all manner of topics for many years now.

Now, I can tell you're a smart lad...



Lately, I've been thinking it's time for me to
pass some of my wisdom down, and I think
you're the one I'm going to pass it down
to... Count yourself lucky, lad!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Everything that you see tacked to the walls
here is something that I've researched
thoroughly. And before you ask, yes,
I do know my filing system is odd.
Organizational issues aside, however, it's
all extremely useful information. You would
do well to read it all very carefully.
Reading leads to knowing, you know!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Such a racket! Can't you keep quiet!?
You've knocked everything off my
shelves, you dratted hooligan!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Honestly! The hooligan I'm referring to
is my younger and much less intelligent
brother, who lives just downstairs...

He hates studying. All day, every day, the
lout just exercises and practices with his
weapons. Does he exercise his brain? No!
The brain's a muscle, too! ...I think.
Anyway, the only thing he DOES study is
the art of fighting. Right now, for instance,
he's been studying fencing and whatnot. As
if that's of any use to anyone...
He simply doesn't know how to do anything
besides exercise. I ask you, what's a
brother to do?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You're a smart lad, [player_name].



You'll find that everything I've written down
and tacked to my walls will be very useful
in life. A lifetime of knowledge, all for you!

You just be sure to take the time to read it
all through very carefully.


If you don't, you'll surely end up like that
useless hooligan of a little brother of mine
who lives downstairs.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh! [player_name]? You've come back!
And in one piece, too! Gracious!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
My granddaughter tells me that your
grandmother is in poor health these days...


Now, I'm certain that a little fairy dust
would provide all the lift her spirits need,
but... Well, the problem is, I haven't seen
any fairies in these parts recently.
Of course, long ago you could find a lot of
them up by the old Fairy Fountain, and
you could even capture them in empty
bottles. Sure! It was easy as you please!
Yes, there was a time when I used to like
playing with fairies... Uh...ahem! In any
case, ever since the fountain was blocked
up by that huge rock, I haven't seen a one...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I tell you, my boy, this island has seen
more than its share of trouble lately.


Night after night, monsters appear in town.
The fiends! They come to ravage our
peaceful little island. Why? None know.

And yet...it seems they don't desire to do
harm to us villagers... It's quite puzzling,
even for my larger-than-average intellect.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The island has fallen on hard times
lately, my young lad.


You must have noticed all the monsters
on your way here tonight. They come after
dark to ravage our poor little village.

And yet...it seems they are not here to
harm us villagers... Quite puzzling.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Before the Fairy Fountain was plugged by
that rock, you could always find fairies
there. In fact, long ago, I used to put them
in empty bottles and play with them.
I don't see many fairies these days, though.
It's sad, how life's little pleasures have
a way of slipping through the cracks of
time, isn't it? Ah, well.
In any case, your grandmother will need
some fairy dust if she is to get better.


Then again, I suppose seeing you and Aryll
safe and happy again is more important to
her than anything else!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The monsters appear night after night
and rampage across the island.


What could they possibly want here?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Did you see them? They come every night
after dark. What could they want here?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Wh-Why, that's a Swordsman's Crest!



Have you already shown that to my
brother downstairs?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Must you show it off like that...?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If you want to know what that thing is,
ask my brother downstairs.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I just saw a wild...a wild pig!
Ooh! See? Look! That black one there...
Don't you see him?

This is perfect! My wife was just telling
me how she really wanted a pet...


You ready to go grab it, [player_name]?
Now, you can't just run up on it!
Pigs are too alert about their surroundings
for you to just jog up and capture one.
If you want to get close to one, you have to
hold [R] to crouch and tilt [+] to crawl
slowly up behind it. Slowly...

You could also distract it with bait,
I guess.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Remember, you can't frighten those oinkers!
Hold [R] to crouch and use [+] to slowly
crawl up behind them. And then POUNCE!!!
...Or you could just give them bait.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If you come across wild pigs, you've got to
be careful not to scare them. What you
need to do is open your heart to them.
...Yeah, you heard me right!
For example, you can feed them bait to
settle them down, or hold [R] and use [+] to
slowly crawl up behind them. That way,
you won't startle them and they'll like you.
Oh, and remember to put away anything
you're holding before you press [R] to
crouch. You can't go crawling around with
stuff in your hands!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Wild animals scare easily. Just trust me on
this one, all right?


The secret is to put them at ease by
feeding them bait. Or you can press
[R] and use [+] to sneak up on them.

Just remember to put away anything you
have in your hand before you press [R]
to crouch.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name], your sister, Aryll... She's...



Don't tell me... You're not going to board
that ship and try to save her, are you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Listen, I can imagine how you must feel...
but think about it for a second!


Setting out like this means many long hours
of toil and hardship lie ahead of you.


Are you really prepared to see this quest
all the way through to the end, without
giving up halfway through, [player_name]?!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh! [player_name]! You made it back!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Nasty things have been happening here at
night ever since you left on that boat...


You'd better head home early today...
And don't come out to play until long
after the sun has risen tomorrow.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The pig you caught for us has really grown
up since the last time you saw him, hasn't
he? You'd better believe it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
He's really put on the pounds, too. In fact,
I've had such a hard time getting him over
the fence lately that I didn't think I'd be
able to do it anymore without an assistant.
But look at you! You picked him up as if he
were light as a feather! That's unbelievable!
You know, [player_name]...

It doesn't seem like it's been all that long
since you first left here, but you're MUCH
stronger than I remember you being.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Say, [player_name], do you remember the
day you first caught this oinker and
brought him over here?

Just look at that thing! Isn't he a lot bigger
now than the last time you saw him? And
not just bigger... He's a lot heavier, too!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Say, [player_name], is there any way you
could pick him up and take him for a walk
for me? I'd really appreciate it! My
back is just killing me...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Isn't our pig just mind-bogglingly huge?
We caught him after you left the island,
but who knew he'd get so big?

Even if I wanted to take him out for a
walk, he's so heavy now that it's all I can
do just to heave him over the fence.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Say, [player_name], you look pretty
strapping... I bet you could lift him!
Could you do me a favor and take this guy
for a walk?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Isn't our pig just monstrously huge?
We caught him after you left, but I had no
idea he'd get so big!

Even if I wanted to take him for a walk,
it's all I can do to just get him outside
the fence, nowadays.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But...you just picked him up as if he were
light as a feather! That's mind-blowing!


Wow, [player_name]! I didn't think it had
been that long since you first left, but
you must have been working out every day
since then! You're a powerhouse!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It's too dangerous to walk around outside
at night. I'm being serious, here.


If you want to play with the boys, come
back after the sun has come up. The boys
will be here waiting.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hey, if you've got free time, why don't you
come back when it's light out and take our
pig for a walk?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You know our pet pig? Well, to be honest...
We named him after you! Lucky you!


He's very smart, just like you. And just like
you, when you feed him some bait, he starts
digging with all his might until he digs up
treasure. ...Wait, you don't do that!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I'm still having trouble believing that you
were able to lift our pig up over your head
like that... You're so burly!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I wouldn't mind you testing your might by
picking up that pig, [player_name], as long
as you take him for a walk afterward.
What do you say?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Our pig is really smart, just like you.
But unlike you, when you feed him some
bait, he starts digging with all his might
until he digs up treasure.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You really should try it yourself...
But I don't know, [player_name]...
Do you even think you can lift him?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You're obviously strong enough to lift the
pig over the fence... Do you think you could
take him for a walk for me?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name]...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If you have time, could you maybe take our
little [player_name] for a walk?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I suppose I should congratulate you on
your birthday, shouldn't I?


Well, to tell the truth, I could congratulate
myself, too. We just finished building our
little hutch and paddock today! Isn't it a
delightful addition to the place?
I was actually thinking of getting a pet and
keeping it here. The boys would really like
that, I'm sure. Boys love pets!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I wonder what kind of animal we should
get... What do kids like these days?
Listen, dearie, if you see any good pets
around, be a lamb and just bring one here.
If you do, I'll give you a little reward.
Oh! But we won't tell your grandma about
it, will we?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If you find an animal that would make a
good pet, just bring it here and put it
inside the fence, all right?

I'll give you a little spending money
if you do! And won't that be nice?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Why, did you bring that little piglet all the
way here just for me?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh! Thank you! Thank you so much!
I've been thinking of getting a pet
pig for a while now. The boys will be SO
happy when they get home. You sweetie!
OK, [player_name]... Hold out your hand.
This is your reward! Don't spend
it all in one place!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Why, this little darling is cute as a button!
You know, it's so cute that I wouldn't mind
having even more of them!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Why, did you find these pigs and bring
them here just for little old me?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh! Thank you! Thank you so much!
I've been thinking of getting a
pet pig for a while now. Oh, and the boys
will be SO happy when they get home.
OK, [player_name], hold out your hand...
This is your reward...
Don't spend it all in one place!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
And this is our gratitude for bringing us
new family members!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Why, these little darlings are so adorable
that I wouldn't mind having even more of
them! No, I wouldn't mind a bit!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Why, did you find these pigs and bring
them here just for little old me?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

And here's our gratitude for bringing us new

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
And finally, this is to congratulate you for
working so hard on your birthday!
Happy birthday to YOOOOOUUUU!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I suppose now I'll have to name these
little oinking cutie-kins...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Why, did you bring me another piglet?



Oh, were you all worried that this little guy
would get lonely hanging out inside the
fence all by himself? That is the sweetest
thing I've ever heard!
Thank you SO much for bringing us yet
another family member.


Here's a little something for you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If you find any other little piggies,
you know where to bring them!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Did you bring me another piglet? What?
You brought me a pair?!


Oh, you thought this little guy would get
all lonely behind the fence by himself?
That is SO sweet! Now they can have a
little pig party in there! Sooo-eee!
Thank you so much for bringing us a new
family member!

Thank you, thank you, thank you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
And this is for working so hard on
your birthday!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I suppose now I'll have to think up names
for these little cutie-poos...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ooh! Ooh! Look at this one! You sure do
know where to find the cutest pigs on the
whole Great Sea! Hey, oinker! Oink! Oink!

Oh, now things will be ever so much more
lively in the pen. It'll be like a big pig
jamboree in there!
Thank you so much!
Oh! That's right...
I can't let you leave without
giving you a present...
Happy birthday, [player_name]!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I guess I'd better think up some names
for these little oinky-woinkies, huh?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name]! Don't you worry about
giving them exercise. I'll take the pigs out
for a walk whenever they need it. Be a
lamb and leave them behind the fence, OK?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Any pig as cute as this one is welcome in
my pen! You just go ahead and bring me
however many you like!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Look at how much space there is in that
pen! I'll tell you what... If you find any
other lost little piggies, you just go right
ahead and bring them here! OK?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What should I name these little oinkers...?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Say, [player_name]...did something
happen to you?


You don't look well...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I'm so glad you're safe, [player_name]!



We've all been so worried...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
And the boys have been longing to see
you again!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The boys will be so surprised to hear
you've returned! ...Just as soon as they
wake up, that is.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, did you notice how large the pig you
gave us has grown? It's a king among pigs!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Things got so quiet and lonely after you
left the island...

So we decided to get a pet pig!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
'Hoy, [player_name]!



Hey, is it true that if you just have a
little courage and run as fast as you can,
then you can jump to that rock out there?
Huh, is it? Is it? Tell me!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hey! Aren't you listening to me?
I've been trying to ask you...


Is it true that you can jump to that rock
out there just by running as fast as you
can? I've gotta know, or I'll burst!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Wow... I hope I'll be able to jump like
you some day, [player_name]...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name], are you going somewhere?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hey! Aren't you listening to me?



Don't go, [player_name]!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name]!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Lots and lots of things have happened here
since you left, [player_name]!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
First of all, my little brother doesn't wet
the bed anymore, so that's good, I guess.


And Mom got kind of chubby again.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hey! You shush!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
And, umm... Umm...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, yeah! And now, when you feed old
[player_name] bait, he gets real excited
and digs holes in the hard patches of
black dirt you see around the village.
He always finds treasure in them! Yeah!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yes, we named the pig you caught for us
after you... I hope you don't mind!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yup, that's our pet pig's name...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I can't believe all it takes to get
[player_name] all excited is a little bait.
Talk about a dummy!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The pig! He's talking about our pig, not you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
We don't have any other pigs anymore.



We used to, but then we had to...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hey! You shush!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
They just... They just ran away somewhere.



Yup! That's all! They just up and ran away
one day...
Yup...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It was delicious!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Shush!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Th-The milk you just drank was delicious,
ri-right? That's what you meant, wasn't it,
my darling son?

What am I to do with these boys...?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, ho ho ho ho ho ho!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But about those other pigs you caught
for us, [player_name]...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Umm... See, [player_name]...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name]... Shouldn't you go back to
your house? I mean, isn't your grandma
waiting for you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It was delicious!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Shush!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What am I to do about these boys...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, ho ho ho ho ho ho ho!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So? So? So?


So...aren't those clothes hot?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So...what are you doin'?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
No?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Don't go!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yay! [player_name]!!! It's [player_name]!!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So? So? So?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So...did you save Aryll?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hey! Shush!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I'm sorry, [player_name]. Don't you pay any
attention to him...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So? So? So?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So...haven't you saved Aryll yet?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Shush!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ah! 'Hoy, Big Brother!



Did Grandma make that outfit for you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But wow... You look like you'd be way too
hot in those clothes...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I guess they're pretty neat, though!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So, anyway, [player_name]...



Can you close your eyes and hold out
your hand? Just for a second!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I'm going to give you my most treasured
belonging...but just for one day!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So? Well?! Do you like it?



I'm letting you borrow this special gift
just because you're my big brother!
Aren't you lucky?! Hee hee hee! 
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ooh, why don't you try it out! Right now!
Try looking over at our house from here!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Don't you know how to use my Telescope?
It's really easy to use, Big Brother...


Press START/PAUSE, then set the Telescope
to [Y], [Z], or [X] on the Items screen.
Then you can use it just by pressing the
button you set it to! It's simple!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hey, what's that? [player_name]! Are you
looking at the red postbox?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The postman looks kinda weird, doesn't he?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
AAAAAHH! [player_name]!
The sky! Look up in the sky!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name], this is so terrible! That girl
fell into the forest! You have to go help her!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name], this is so terrible! That girl
fell into the forest! She needs help!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...But it's too dangerous for you to go in
there without something you can use to
defend yourself with!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Wh-What are you going to do if you go into
the forest and that big bird attacks you?!


You need something to fight it off with!!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, I hope whoever fell into the forest is
all right! This is so terrible...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
That giant bird has just been flying around
searching for whoever it dropped. It'll find
her soon, I just know it!

Oh, what do we do? What do we do? You
have to find her and save her, quickly!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Big Brother! Are you using [C][v] to zoom in?
'Cause you should be!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If you press [X], you can look through
the Telescope! Neat, huh?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If you press [Y], you can look through
the Telescope! Neat, huh?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If you press [Z], you can look through
the Telescope! Neat, huh?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Big Brother!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Big Brother!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I knew you'd be here!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hee hee hee! This is my FAVORITE spot to
gaze out at the sea. When I play with the
gulls, I call it "Aryll's Lookout."
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So, do you remember what day it is today?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...You're still half-asleep, aren't you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Did you forget?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Big Brother, it's your birthday!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
That's why Grandma has been waiting for
you to come back to the house! She's been
waiting for a while now...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It's a good thing I came to find you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You should probably go home and see what
Grandma wants, don't you think?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hurry up, Big Brother! Grandma is waiting
for you back at the house! And I'm sure
everyone else on the island wants to say
hello to you, too!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name]...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Is this what you're looking for?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...Take it with you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I guess it is true... Aryll really has been
kidnapped... Hasn't she?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What kind of monster could take such a
sweet, young child?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, Aryll...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, my! [player_name]! Congratulations!
That outfit looks cute on you!


Hey, your little sister, Aryll, was looking for
you not too long ago.


Oh, did I tell you? She was watching me
not too long ago, and she said she wanted
to learn to carry jars on her head, too,
so she could help your grandma do chores.
Hey! If you see Aryll, tell her that all she
needs to do to lift a jar is stand in front of
it and press [A]. And to set it down, she
just needs to press [R]! Tell her, OK?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

What's that? Today is your birthday? Well,
congrats, buddy! Are you that old already?
Wow! Time just flies right by, doesn't it?
You blink and POOF! There goes a year!
Why, I swear I just cut the grass in this
field the other day, but look at how tall
it's gotten already...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Say, do you want to try cutting it,
[player_name]? You'd be surprised at
the things people drop in the grass.
It's fun! It's like a treasure hunt.
Except...you're gonna need some kind of
grass-cutting tool if you want to cut the
grass. That's just common sense, buddy.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What say you, [player_name]?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Wh-Wh-Wh-What!? What do you want?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
OOOWWWWCH!!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Wow. What's with that get-up?
Well, whatever. So, where am I...?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, that's right! That giant bird came and...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Huh? What're you showing me this for?
This is just a regular old letter.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Miss!
Miss Tetra!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh! Oh, thank... Thank goodness!
You're safe!


When I saw you get dropped on this summit,
I thought for sure you'd...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Summit?



So that bird dropped me on the top of
a mountain?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Well, wasn't that nice of it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Well, don't just stand there!
Let's go!
Time to repay our debt to that bird in full!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But, Miss... What about this boy?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Don't worry about him. Come on!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
'Hoy! Big Brother!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Brother!!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Uhhn! Stupid kid!
Get ahold of yourself! She's gone.
There's nothing you can do.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What?!?
You want to come with us on our ship?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Do you understand what you're asking?
We're pirates! You know... PIRATES!
The terror of the seas!

What do we get out of bringing some
helpless little kid along with us?
I'll tell you what we get...a headache.

I know how you must feel, with your
sister having been kidnapped and all...


But that doesn't really have anything to
do with us, now does it?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
And how do you figure that...?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Whoa, whoa, whoa there! Just who are
you?! Where do you get off butting in on
someone else's conversation?!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Please! All I mean to say is that if you
big, bad pirates hadn't come to this quiet
little island...

That poor girl wouldn't have been snatched
away by that bird.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
And just what do you mean by that?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Just be quiet for a moment, and I'll tell you!



Now, as my work entails delivering letters,
I spend much of my time traveling amongst
the many different islands. As a result,
I hear many things...
Haven't any of you heard word that young
girls have been getting kidnapped lately
from all regions of the Great Sea?

No matter. Whether you've heard it or not,
that seems to be the case. Young girls with
long ears like yours have been getting
kidnapped, never to be seen again.
And unless my eyes fail me, the young girl
who was just kidnapped from this island
also has long ears, does she not? Much
like YOU do, Miss Fearsome Pirate.
My point is that the bird mistook that poor
girl for you, and that's why it grabbed her!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
......
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
And correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe it
was young [player_name] here who saved
you from the monsters in the forest,
wasn't it?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...Is this true?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh! And while I'm at it...



I may as well tell you that the bird that
kidnapped both you and [player_name]'s
sister has made its foul nest to the north,
on the heights of the Forsaken Fortress.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The Forsaken Fortress?!



Isn't that the place where...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So, what are you going to do?



Under the circumstances, I don't think it
would be unreasonable for you to give
[player_name] a little help, now, would it?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hmph... I don't need you to tell me that!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Even if I were to consider it...
Lately, I've heard nothing but evil rumors
about this Forsaken Fortress...

You can't possibly mean to go there with
nothing but that cheap little sword!
That's not brave! It's stupid!

I mean, come on! Even a simple little island
like this has to have something you could
use as a shield. You know, something to
protect yourself with? Anything?
Tell you what. If you come back with
something like that, we'll let you stow
away on our ship.

Oh, and one more thing: once we leave,
you won't be coming back here for a while,
so you'd better go say good-bye to your
family while you have the chance.
I don't want you getting all weepy-eyed
and homesick on me!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Are you ready?
Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Well, hurry up, already! If you take much
longer, we're going to leave without you!
Don't think we won't!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
This is a terrible situation, [player_name]...
I'm truly sorry.


Unfortunately, I can't go in your stead...
but if anything happens, please come to my
island. I will do what I can to aid you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Don't worry about your home while you're
gone. If anything bad happens, I promise to
bring word of it to you. I swear it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
She can't be serious! What is she thinking,
bringing a shrimp like you on board?!
Talk about a joke...

Boy, Miss Tetra's impulsive nature sure has
a way of landing us in hot water...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Listen, shrimp, whatever young Miss says
goes, so do what you have to do and be
quick about it, yeah?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Heya, shrimplet! Are you gonna be our new
pirate swabbie?


...'Cause any new swabbie reports to me!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Helloooooooo, new pirate swabbie!
Goooooood-bye, dirty pirate underwear!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yes! This means I don't have to wash the
other pirates' dirty underpants anymore!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Shrimp! If you're going to go sailing on a
pirate ship, you better be prepared to
become a pirate, yeah?

'Cause if you get scared and start begging
and crying at us to let you off the ship
somewheres, then you're guaranteed to end
up as shark bait!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Good luck, [player_name]!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Good luck finding Aryll!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Take care of yourself!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ugh... How much longer is this going to go
on, do you think? Do you have an estimate?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Are you sure you shouldn't just quit right
now? Seriously, think about it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I can tell you're just going to get more
sentimental from here on out.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
There's still time, you know...
Are you sure we shouldn't just turn around
and take you back to your island?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Gooood moooorrrning!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Gooood eeeevening!

Welcome to the Island Postal Service!
What do you have for delivery?

Krzzzzt! PAHHHFT!
This letter has no addressee written on it.
Please deliver it yourself...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Letters for [player_name]?
We have [?]!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Well met, Hyrule King!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Well met indeed, Jabun. I am pleased to see
that you are safe...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The events which we have long feared seem
to have been set into motion.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yes. It seems Ganon has returned. There can
be no other explanation.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If you have sought me out...it must mean
you have found the Hero of Time,
does it not?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Unfortunately, that is not so.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Then for what purpose have you come to
see me?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The one I have brought with me has no
connection to the legendary one.


And yet I sense great promise in the
courage that this one possesses.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Promise?



You suggest that I leave the fate of Hyrule
up to mere chance?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I do. It is the only way.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I see. Then I suppose it is up to the gods
to deem whether his courage is true.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I give to you the guidepost to the gods.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
This jewel should dispel the curse that
Ganon has cast upon this land.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So...that foul rain and endless night were
indeed elements of a curse brought on us
by Ganon! He must intend to cast this land
into pure darkness for all time...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Tell me, Hyrule King...
Have you learned the whereabouts of the
one who carries on the bloodline of the
princess, Zelda?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...I believe I have.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
That is well. You must protect Zelda.
She cannot be permitted to fall into the
hands of Ganon.

I am counting on you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ganon's curse has been broken by the
power of the pearl that Jabun gave us,
so morning should come soon. It is well
that we have gathered all of the pearls.

Are you ready, [player_name]?


I have marked the places where you must
set the pearls on your Sea Chart.


Once you have placed each of the pearls in
its proper location, the proving grounds for
your courage will become apparent.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Clearly, the search for Jabun has shown
that Ganon has begun to make efforts to
block our path forward.

It is certain that the perils ahead will be
greater than any you have faced thus far.


You should finish any business you have
here on Outset right now, so that you shall
not have any regrets later.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ahhh! I was forgetting something important!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, Mr. Fairy! You want to come to my
island, don't you?
Don't you? Don't you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
When you go out to sea, open it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If you ever need any help with your charts,
just leave it to Tingle! Don't ever forget it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If you ever need help with charts...


Don't forget it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh! Mr. Fairy!
I've been longing to see you, sir!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yah! [player_name]! I... I must say I've been
wanting to see you very badly!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What should we play? What do you want to
play? What? You're not here to play?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Next time, bring me one of my favorites:
a chart I haven't seen yet! Please, sir, just
bring me one! Please!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
 To the esteemed Mr. Fairy-Person,

 Thank you very much for your purchase.
 Enclosed is an IN-credible Chart.
 This chart will show you where you can
 find the Triforce Charts. I want you to use
 it to find lots of them_they are my favorite
 kind of charts!
 And also, sir, have you been checking your
 Tingle Chart? Have you seen those giant
 fairy marks? Follow the chart to them and
 your fortune will increase greatly!
                                          Tingle
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If you're here for shrimp, you're just in time!
Huh?! Wait! No!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
My older brother has the same face I do,
but he wears green clothes, just like the
hero of legend.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hooo... I've put it on display down below.
You should look at it on your way down.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Goodbye, Mr. Fairy! 
Please come visit me here at Tingle Tower 
again, where wonderful fairy magic makes
the place spin and spin!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hmmmmm?!? That fragrant musty scent!
Sir! You have found a chart!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Splendid! Splendid!
Show me! Show me!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Why, you can't read that chart in its
current state! Impossible, sir!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Would you like me to decipher it for you?
...For 398 Rupees?
Sure
No thanks
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ehhh...
Mr. Fairy... Are you...poor?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You don't have enough
Rupees, sir!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Well... Well, I guess that's fine.
You can just return later to Tingle Tower,
where the wonderful fairy magic keeps the
world spinning and spinning!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Tingle! Tingle!
Kooloo-limpah!
Become...READABLE!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Would you like me to decipher another
chart for 398 Rupees?
Sure
No thanks
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hmmm... Mr. Fairy! I have marked
the location of the Triforce shard on your
IN-credible Chart, too!

When you open this chart by pressing [Y]
on your Sea Chart, the place where the
treasure is will shine forth!

Then, just go to that place and rely on
your chart to help you find the treasure!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Heave... Ho...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Why must we rotate this thing like this!
This life is so very hard for us all...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Heave-ho...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Heave... Ho...
Ugh! This is heavy!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Day in and day out, I work. You want to
know the secret of how I ended up here?
Yes
Not really
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I know you probably have a hard time
believing someone dressed as I am, but...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
This guy here and I are complete and utter
strangers! I kid you not!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Once upon a time, I was a sailor.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
One night, as I was floating aimlessly
across the sea as I usually did...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
That night... Yes, I remember it vividly.
There was a fierce and terrible storm!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I was swallowed up by a giant twister,
and my boat was spun round and round!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...That is the last thing I remember.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
When I awoke, I was dressed like this!
And what do you think I was doing?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But I guess telling this story to you won't
do me any good... It sure won't get that
crazy guy in green off my back!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I suppose if you don't want to hear my tale,
there is nothing I can do about it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Just taking time to talk gives me a
little bit of a rest... It's nice...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ahhh...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh! It's so heavy! Isn't there anyone who
can spin this thing for me?!?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
This is just between you and me...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But this guy has another brother. If that
guy could just come spin this thing instead
of me...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Heave... Ho...
Hooo...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
That guy's younger brother down below...
That blue guy... He doesn't help out at all!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
He just hangs out down there, standing
guard and making sure no one writes any
graffiti on Tingle Tower! That's all!
No manual labor whatsoever!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But who would even bother vandalizing
this place?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hey! Mr. Fairy!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Some outrageous fellow threw this
fantabulous Tingle Statue into the sea!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It is sad to know there is one on this sea
who does not even know the meaning
of beauty!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But not you, Mr. Fairy! You are different!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Big Brother! I was worried about you!
Huh?!? You are not my brother!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
My brother said he was going to Windfall
Island, but it has been so long...and still he
does not come back!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
My brother looks just like me!
And he wears clothes just like yours!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I am certain you will know him the moment
you set eyes on him. Can you not look for
him for me?

If he were here, he could decipher any
chart you have that needs deciphering,
no matter how difficult it is to read...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Windfall Island is northeast of here.



If my brother were here, he could decipher
any chart you have that needs deciphering,
no matter how hard it is to read...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Um... You have a Tingle Tuner, do you not?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Uh...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
No, if you do not have one, do not
worry about it. If you lack a Tingle Tuner...
It is sort of complicated, I suppose...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
No, no. Do not go out of your way.
No, really.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I mean, it is quite useful...The Tingle Tuner,
I mean. But no, really. I would not expect
you to...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
My brother is so happy on days when you
call him up, Mr. Fairy. So very happy!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Words of Joy
Breathe deep and read it loud and proud!


Joy is hidden in all the places of the world.
You must widen your eyes and search for it.


The first joy you find earns you a present.



With 20, you become a joy steward.



With 40, you'll have the look of a hero.
Aren't all of these things joyous?
Me, you... We'll all be full of joy!

Hey! That's a pretty slick boat you got
there, kiddo!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So what do you say, kiddo? You wanna
play a boat game for 30 Rupees?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What do you say?
Tell me the rules
I'll play now
No thanks
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Well, I ain't that good a talker...



But here goes... Now listen up!



The deal is, you take your boat and sail
over the barrels floatin' in the water and
see how many Rupees you can bring to the
finish line within the time limit.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
There's two kinds of floatin' barrels you
gotta watch out for: the ones that float on
their sides and the ones that float upright.

You can get the Rupees above the barrels
floatin' on their sides by just sailin'
right over the barrels...

But if you run into the barrels floatin'
upright in the water, they'll rough you up.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You know you can press [R] to jump your
boat, right?


Yeah, well, to get the Rupees over the
upright barrels, you gotta jump with [R]!
It's the only way!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The barrels get placed out there based on
which way the wind's blowin'...


So watch that wind gauge behind your boat
real careful-like!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, and one more thing: if time runs out
before you finish, you lose! So watch the
timer, too, will ya?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Them's the rules!



What do you say? Wanna give it a shot?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, yeah! This time I've taken 10 seconds
off the timer, so you gotta be a little
faster than before.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What's the matter, kiddo? You want to play
after all? Heh.


I can tell by that look in your eye!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Whoa! You wanna play again?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What's the deal? You got yourself a boat
because you're hopin' to make it in the
world, right? You wanna get rich, right?

Well, playin' my game'll make you money
faster than sailin' around lookin' for
treasure! Oh, well! Your loss, kiddo!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Really? Ah, well. That's how it goes.



But hey! If you change your mind, come
back and see me, OK, kiddo?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...[player_name]!? Listen, kid, you can't
just stand around on deck! You'll get in
everyone's way!

I've told Niko to look after you, so you'd
better report below decks and ask him what
you should be doing.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I'll call you when we reach the Forsaken
Fortress, so until then, just go talk to
Niko and do whatever he tells you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Listen, shrimp, you're really creeping me out
standing there like that! So quit it, yeah? 
Stay outta my way! WAY outta my way!
Go down below and find Niko!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hey! Zuko! You keep a strict watch up
there, yeah?! If you spot anything, give us
a shout! A LOUD shout!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

What are you doing, shrimp!? Miss Tetra is
waiting for you up in the crow's nest!

Shake a leg, yeah? Go! Hoof it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So, your name's [player_name], right?
Heh heh heh!


That's one weird get-up you got on, there.
So what's the deal? Is that popular back
on your island, or what?

Now that I think about it, though...
I think I've seen an outfit like
that before somewhere...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You know, come to think of it, I think
there's a picture of someone in an outfit
like yours hanging on the wall down in
Miss Tetra's cabin...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So that's the Forsaken Fortress...
What an evil-looking place...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You! Get outta the way, will ya?!



......
Turn around right now! Climb down!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So... You really plan on going...
into the Forsaken Fortress?
...Listen, I'll tell you once I see it.
So climb down, will ya?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The young Miss...
is waiting for you up above.


We've reached the Forsaken Fortress.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hmmm! That Niko didn't make out half-bad.
...With you being the new swabbie and all.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You should know... There's always a test
when a new pirate swabbie joins up.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Was Niko's test...easy?
...Really?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Stop right there! This is Miss Tetra's cabin!



Most of us REAL pirates aren't even allowed
in here! There's no way we're letting an
outsider in! Don't you even THINK it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You're probably wondering why we treat
young Miss Tetra with so much respect
when she's clearly so much younger than
us, aren't you, now?
Now, I won't go saying this in a very loud
voice, but while she may look young...
Miss Tetra's actually 35!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
HAR! That's a joke, shrimpy!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ahoy there, young shrimpy! It sounds like
we've actually arrived! Head on up to the
deck and have a look-see, why don't you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh! Well now! Ahoy there, swabbie!
As of today... EH-HEH-AHEM!
I am your superior... Niko! Now, I promise I'll
go easy on you, so you do as I say, OK?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Right! Now, first off you have to take the
test all new pirates have to take. It's a bit
of a doozy, so get ready!

You watch everything I'm about to show you
real careful-like so you can cram it into
your no-doubt mushy swabbie brain!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
First off, you gotta press this switch.
This is the only easy part.


Just walk up to it and tilt [+] [v] to step
on it. Presto! Switch pressed!


¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Now, check it out! After the platforms rise
up from the floor, you gotta jump on them!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
OK, so I was able to jump to this first one
myself...but that next one is too far, right?


That's when you gotta do THIS!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If you jump right at the rope, you can grab
onto it and use [+][v][^] to swing. Swing until
you get close enough to the next platform
then press [A] to let go and jump to it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So, do you think you get how to do it?
You have to swing from platform to
platform and try to get to the entrance
of that room over there!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Here's the problem, though, swabbie!
The platforms only stay raised for a little
while, so if you don't get there by the time
they drop, you have to start over!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It will probably take you at least one year
before you're good enough to make it all
the way here. One rough year. One tough
year, full of bumps and bruises.
Of course, if you manage to do it faster,
I'll reward you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Now, give it a try! This ought to be good
for a chuckle or two!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hey! What are you doing? You have to jump
and make it over here! Falling isn't part
of the program, swabbie!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Whaaaaat!? You did it already???



.........
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I... I... I'm proud to have you as...
As my... As my underling!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I... I wonder if it's OK to just give that to him...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...I don't see why not... I doubt I'll get busted...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
All right, swabbie! I'll tell you what!
You can have the treasure in that chest
over there! It's your reward from the great
and generous Niko!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hu-Hurry up and take it! I'm serious!
Grab it and get outta here!


Someone might come! Hurry up, swabbie!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Gah! But there's still so much stuff I have
to teach you... This is so lame!


Ahh, well... I guess it can wait until you
finish whatever it is you have to do.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Come back and see me again after you
finish your errand, OK, swabbie?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hey! [player_name]! We've reached the
Forsaken Fortress! Hurry and get up here!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, there's one thing I forgot to tell you.



When you're hanging on to a rope, you can
hold [R] then tilt [<][+][>] to change direction
and tilt [+][v][^] to climb up and down. Try it
if you don't like the angle of the next jump.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hurry and take it before someone comes!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
'Cause I can never figure out what you're
trying to say! THAT'S why you've gotta be
sure to shout, Zuko!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
New swabbies always get stuck doing the
hardest work. It's a real raw deal, but hey.


I'll tell you... It sure sounds like Niko is
happy to finally not be the bottom rung on
the pirate ladder! You bet he is!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...Hey, but don't sweat it. I'm sure you'll do
just fine, so long as you don't disobey him.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I guess you could say it's our way of
welcoming new swabbies. Yup. That it is.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
One way or the other, you'll figure out what
it is you gotta do once you get below
decks. Then be sure to do it. Yup. Do it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I suppose it was just chance that we lost
our last Miss when Miss Tetra was still
young. Hooo... Fate is cruel, she is.

That's why Miss Tetra took over so young.
She owes it to her predecessor.


Everyone's come to respect her for that.
For coping with so much, at such an age.


Respect has nothing to do with how many
years you've been on the earth. But you're
probably too young to understand that.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hey! [player_name]!
Here I am! Up here!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What were you doing with Niko?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Don't tell me you were playing some stupid
game for treasure...were you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...Well, whatever!
There's something you need to see!
Have a look over there...

That's the cursed isle known as the
Forsaken Fortress.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
There are all sorts of strange rumors about
this place. What I do know is that long
ago, it used to be the hideout of a no-good
group of pirates we used to compete with...
But they were just small-time. Now, the
place looks like it's pretty dangerous.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ah! I knew it! Look!
Over there! By that window!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Have you ever seen so many seagulls flock
like that before?


...I'll bet you anything that's the place
where they've got your sister locked up!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...But it looks like the whole place is under
really tight guard.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
This won't work... We'd be spotted before
we got anywhere near landing there.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hmmm... What do we do now?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Look, don't struggle. If you really want to
get into a dangerous place like that, this is
the only way to do it. Trust me.

We pirates do this all the time. Don't worry
about it! It'll be a piece of cake!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Is everybody ready!?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Never you fear, kid. We're pros. We're going
to launch you good!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hmmmmmm! I see the same green clothes
and the same green hat!
By the look of you, I'd say...
Sir! Could you, by chance, be...a fairy?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Goodness! Did you feel my telepathy?!
That's why you saved me, isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Do not worry! Tingle knows without you
telling him, sir! Yes, sir!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Tingle is my name! I have been looking for
you and your kind, for I, too, long to be
one of the fairy folk!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
And yet, I was mistaken for some kind of
troublemaker and put into this dreadful
sort of place!

How disrespectful!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Please, Mr. Fairy... Rescue poor Tingle from
this place and take him to where you and
your kind live in splendor!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If you help me, I will give you a
fabulous present!
Soooo...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Why! If it isn't Mr. Fairy!



Do you remember poor Tingle?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hooooo... You're mean. You're terrible. You're
not even lifting a finger. And after poor
Tingle begged you to help him like that...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Sir, do you, by chance, enjoy watching me
suffer? Is this lack of assistance done
intentionally...?

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
No, that cannot be true!
Fairies are good beings.
Tingle sees all, he does! He does!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Please, Mr. Fairy! Please rescue poor
Tingle and take him to where you and your
kind live in harmony!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If you help me, I will give you a
fabulous present!
Sooooo...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hoorayyyy! Thank you oh so VERRRY much!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Here is Tingle's heartfelt gift of thanks!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Tingle! Tingle!
Kooloo-limpah!
Become an item!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Now, no matter how far we travel from this
dingy cell, our souls will be as one!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Splendid! Tingle is going to get ready to
go to the realm of the fairies, so you just
wait here, OK, sir?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Big Brother!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You're OK!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...I was...worried.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The cell won't open that easily!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
There you go... Acting before you think,
as usual...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I swear! Do you even realize that we had
to draw that monster bird off for you?


It was about to come flying in here after
you again!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...That sword!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Where did you get that?!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Are you... Is it even possible...?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...How could it be?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hmm... Well, never mind about that.
For now, we'll just take these girls.


I'm sure their fathers back in town will pay
a handsome reward for their return.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I'm so sorry to interrupt such a
heartwarming reunion...

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But isn't there still something that you need
to take care of?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If you're worried about your sister...don't be.
I promise I'll deliver her safely back to your
little island.

Normally, I'd expect a huge reward for
something like this...but this time,
it's my treat!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Listen, Aryll, your brother still has some
things to take care of. Big, important,
grown-up things.

He'll be back soon, so you just wait nice
and quiet until he returns, OK?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But, Big Brother...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Miss Tetra! We have to hurry! The bird will
be here any second!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Gonzo! Excellent! You're just in time!
Take this one for me.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Huh?! But she's...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
She's fine! Just do as you're told!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Big Brother!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name]!
We'll be back. I swear it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I swear it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It's been a while, boy.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You have done well to sneak into my
fortress and wriggle your way all the
way up here.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I suppose the least I can do is commend
you for your reckless courage.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
My name is Ganondorf...



And I am the master of Forsaken Fortress.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
By the way, boy... When you drew that
sword of yours out of its resting place...


Did you by chance notice how all of the
monsters frozen in time down there
suddenly began stirring again?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Do you understand precisely what that
means? ...I highly doubt you do.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Foolish child. While that sword is indeed
the blade of evil's bane, at the same time,
it has long played another role...

You see, it is also a sort of key...
a most wretched little key that has kept
the seal on me and my magic intact!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
By withdrawing the blade, you have
broken that seal...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Fool! 
...Why do I waste my breath on a child?
Do you still not understand?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You cannot defeat me with a blade that
does not sparkle with the power to repel
evil! What you hold is useless.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Go back to the world below, and tell that
to the pathetic fools who made this blade!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Its power is gone, and its edges are dull!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name]! Get up!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Uhh! Stop! Let... Let me go!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You pathetic little sea rat!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
          ! ? ! 
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
My Triforce of Power is resonating!



Ha! At long last, I have found you...
Princess Zelda!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Wh-What?! What are you talking about?
I don't know any Zelda...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Feigning ignorance will gain you nothing!



Tell me... If you are not Zelda, then why
do you have this fragment of the Triforce?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It's all right, [player_name]!
She has merely lost consciousness.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Your sister has escaped the Forsaken
Fortress with the pirates. You can relax.
She's safe now.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Lord Valoo! You arrived not a moment too
soon... We are deeply grateful.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Still...it is too soon for us to relax.
Ganon cannot be destroyed by such simple
means as wrath and fire.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I am aware of this.



Yet I thought our first priority should be
to separate these two from Ganon's grasp.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I see...and I agree.
Very well, then! We are counting on you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name], I will explain things later!
Now we must return to the world beneath
the sea!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
O great hero, chosen by the Master Sword!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
My name is Laruto.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I am a Zora sage. For an age, I offered
my prayers here in the Earth Temple,
praying that the power to repel evil would
ever remain within the Master Sword.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
And yet...unfortunately, due to Ganondorf's
evil designs, the Master Sword you hold
has lost this power.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
After his defeat at the hands of the Hero of
Time, Ganondorf was sealed away...but not
for all time. He was revived, and he
returned to Hyrule in a red wrath.
He attacked this temple and stole my soul,
knowing that he had to remove the power
contained in that enchanted blade.

In order to return the power to repel evil to
your sword, you must find another to take
my stead in this temple and ask the gods
for their assistance.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You must find the one who carries on
my bloodline... The one who holds this
sacred instrument...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Nothing can stop the flow of time or the
passing of generations...but the fate carried
within my bloodline endures the ravages of
all the years. It survives.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The song you just conducted is one which
will open the eyes of the new sage and
awaken within that sage the melody that
will carry our prayers to the gods.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The door that blocks your way will only
open when the sage plays that song.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
May the winds of fortune blow with you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Are you the new hero?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I am Fado of the Kokiri tribe. I know I
appear to you as a child, but the eyes can
oft deceive. I am a most esteemed sage.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I had been praying here so that the power
to repel evil would continue to be contained
within the blade of the Master Sword...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But I was attacked by the evil Ganondorf...
and this is what happened to me.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You wish to return the power to your blade,
don't you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
In that case, look for the one who has the
same instrument that I hold, and teach him
the song you just played.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Once you do, I'm certain the holder of the
instrument will feel the blood of the sages
awaken within his veins.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
That Wind Waker you hold was used long
ago to conduct us sages when we played
our song to call upon the gods.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
In those days, it was always the king who
conducted for us...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Please... Tell the king that I will still
play...even in the next world!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
That garb you wear...
Could you be the legendary hero?


Has the king at long last found the
Hero of Time?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What is the matter? Do you not understand
the ancient Hylian tongue?


So...you are not the Hero of Time.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I must apologize. I was in error.
I saw your clothing, and suddenly I felt a
longing for an age gone by... That longing
caused the ancient tongue to pass my lips.
I am the guardian spirit of this Forest
Haven_the Deku Tree.


I owe you my thanks for your aid in ridding
me of those foul creatures...


Tell me... Was it not the King of Red
Lions_the boat who speaks_who led you
to this place?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So it is true...



Then you have come here because you have
need of the pearl of the goddess?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I see...
I knew there was a reason the monsters had
begun to congregate in the regions around
my wood. Now I understand it.
He has returned...
Ganon has returned...


In that case, we must make haste.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Koroks! Little children of the woods!
This traveler is not your enemy. Let your
hearts be at ease, and show yourselves!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What do you call yourself?



[player_name]?



Well, then, [player_name]...
These are the Koroks_the spirits of
the forest.

Once upon a time, long ago, the Koroks
took on human forms, but when they came
to live on the sea, they took these shapes.

Now they fear people...but to me, they will
ever be my cherished little children.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
As it happens, you have come just in time
for a ceremony that the Koroks hold but
once every year. It is about to begin.

I shall grant the pearl to you once their
ceremony is complete.


I must apologize for the brief delay, but if
the ceremony is not completed soon, an ill
fate could befall us.

So, let it begin! Are you ready, my children?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
W-We are not, O Great Deku Tree!
Something terrible has happened!
It is Makar! Makar!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What is the matter, Linder?
You and Makar are always late...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
N-No! It is not that, O Great Deku Tree!
Makar...fell into the Forbidden Woods!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
WHAT?!
The Forbidden Woods?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I told him to be careful! But still Makar
flew above the Forbidden Woods, and as he
drew close to it...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Foolish little Makar...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name], you have heard all this?



The Forbidden Woods are right beside the
hallowed island of our Forest Haven.
Those woods... The whole region is a vile
place that is home to evil beasts.
And now it seems they have taken a child
of the forest named Makar. 

...Your presence here is no mistake, I deem.
The King of Red Lions likely expects great
deeds of you_it is why he brought you here.
I am sorry to ask this of you, but can you
go rescue young Makar for me?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But, Great Deku Tree! ...People cannot
fly through the air...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ah, yes... Thank you, child. You are right.
It is not possible to enter those woods
from the sea, is it...

[player_name], I would guess from your
size that you are heavier than my Korok
children...yet I think we may still be
able to solve this dilemma.
You must use the item I shall bestow
upon you and fly through the sky!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hmmm?



What is this?
You seem to be quite bold.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hmph!



Forgive me, [player_name], but could you
climb up to my crown and get the leaf
from up there?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ah, yes... For one like you to reach the
heights, it will be necessary to use the
Baba Buds scattered around here.

Ask the little Koroks about how to use
them. They shall teach you all you need.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What is the matter?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If you cannot even reach that leaf, there is
no way you will be able to save Makar from
the monsters in the Forbidden Woods.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You will need Magic Power to use my leaf.
You can find magic jars in grass clumps
and vases and after you defeat monsters.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You must build up your reserves of magic
power and use that leaf to fly from the
high cliffs of my Forest Haven over to
the Forbidden Woods!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The Koroks can teach you how to fly.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Please take care of Makar!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Every year after the Koroks perform this
ceremony, they fly off to the distant
islands on the sea and plant my seeds
in the hopes that new forests will grow.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Forests hold great power_they can change
one tiny island into a much larger land.
Soon, a day will come when all the islands
are one, connected by earth and grove.
And the people who live on that great
island will be able to join hands and,
together, create a better world.

Such is my dream.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...But the one you are chasing is trying
to prevent that dream from ever coming
to pass.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name]...



Already, your fate is tied to the fate of this
world. You must proceed with great care.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If ever you find yourself troubled or lost,
return to this haven...


I shall be waiting for you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
How are things in the world,
[player_name]?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
As you can see, I am slowly growing older
and feebler. It seems only my wisdom is
full of vigor lately. But that is just the way
of life, child, and not cause for sadness.
If there is anything you wish to know,
just ask! I will aid you as I may.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What is it you wish to know?
Tell me about the Koroks
Tell me about Forest Water
Nothing
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What do you wish to learn about?
The Koroks
The King of Red Lions
Nothing
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What is the matter? Is there something else
you wish to ask me?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What do you wish to learn about?
The Island Koroks
The Forest Koroks
Nothing
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Are you concerned about the little Koroks
who left the safety of our Forest Haven?


It is indeed true that there are many islands
on the Great Sea that have grown dark
and dangerous. Who knows what perils
might await my children?
I shall mark the places that my Korok
children have journeyed to on your
Sea Chart, [player_name].

Could you be so kind as to check on them
for me as you proceed with your quest?


I entrust their care to you...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
All you need to do is check your Sea Chart
to see where my children are.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But do you not already know about the
Koroks who have left our haven?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You can conduct this melody here, but it
will not do anything.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ahh, if only the Great Deku Tree were
here right now...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
OHHHH! If you don't need Boko Baba Seeds,
I'll buy them for 5 Rupees each!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I'll buy a maximum of [?].
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You want to sell your Boko Baba Seeds?
Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You wish to know about the Koroks who
remain here in the Forest Haven?


Well, you can find Hollo in that hole
over there, researching potions.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
How many do you want to sell?
[?]
Choose how many with [+] and press [A].
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
For [?], I'll pay [?]!



You sure you want to sell?
Yes
Maybe not
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
'Bye! Come again!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But even if I buy them, you can't carry
all those Rupees!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Huh? Then don't show them to me!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
OHHHH! If you don't need your Skull
Necklaces, I'll buy them for 5 Rupees each.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I can buy up to [?].
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You want to sell your Skull Necklaces?
Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
How many do you want to sell?
[?]
Choose how many with [+] and press [A].
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
And as for Makar, well...just look!
He is right there!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
He is busy practicing a new song for next
year's ceremony.


He is already looking forward to it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
As for Makar, he is somewhere here in the
Forest Haven. But I do not know where.


...Outside...perhaps?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I am certain he is practicing his little
leaf cello somewhere. You should be able
to hear his music when you are near to him.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Makar...?



Now that I think about it, I haven't seen
him of late. Perhaps he is hiding somewhere
preparing a song for next year's ceremony.

At such times, he never allows himself to
be seen. It would be useless to look for him.
But do not worry. I am certain he will return
before long.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Is there anything else you wish to ask?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I see. Well, if ever you wish to ask anything
else of me, you are welcome to do so.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The Forest Water?



So, you have learned the secret of our
Forest Haven?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The Forest Water is a mystical and
powerful draught that fills the trees
with life and vitality.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
With such water, it would even be possible
to return life to a battered, withered tree. 
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
And yet, the Forest Water is quickly spoiled
by the air outside the Forest Haven. 


Once it leaves the borders of these woods,
it will lose its potency after just
20 minutes and become no different
from ordinary water.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I suppose it is thanks to such water that
this gnarled, old tree has been able to
live for so many long years.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
When the worst of all possible events
comes to pass, and Ganon is revived
once again...

One shall seek the hero who is destined
to defeat the great evil...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
That is the destiny the goddesses have
placed upon the King of Red Lions.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Since that day, he has been sailing the
Great Sea in search of a young hero not
unlike yourself.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But I cannot yet reveal to you the truth
behind who that boat really is.


Perhaps if you are able to defeat Ganon
as the hero of old once did...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Then, all will be revealed to you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Until then, you must proceed in your quest,
[player_name]. Do not lose your way.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
We Koroks pass most of our days far away
from our sacred Forest Haven, raising new
trees to foster healthy forests on the many
islands of the Great Sea.
Today is the day we were to return to our
home for our annual ceremony.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But poor Makar...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Please, great swordsman! Please save our
brother, Makar!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If we are unable to hold our ceremony, we
will not be able to raise any new forests.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If that comes to pass, then evil days will
follow. The Great Deku Tree's power will
wane, and our power will wane with it...
We might even wither altogether...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The Forbidden Woods were once our home.
They were peaceful back then.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I would guess that our homes should still
exist somewhere deep within the woods.


If you have trouble anywhere in the forest,
just look for the stump-shaped houses.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
High atop the Forest Haven is a branch
that hangs out over the sea. If you take off
from there, you should be able to float to
and enter the Forbidden Woods.
That is what you need the Deku Leaf for.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Wow! You're quite good at that, Mr. Knight!
Just keep doing that until you get all the
way up to the top!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If you shoot out facing the wrong direction,
don't panic! If you don't tilt [+] in
any direction, you'll land safely back in
the Baba Bud.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You're almost to the top! But be careful!
You don't want to fall now that you're so
close. It's only a little higher.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Do you know about this flower? It's called
a Baba Bud. You can stand in front of it
and tilt [+][v] to jump into it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Baba Buds have this peculiar habit of
shooting you up into the air after you
jump into them. So you can use them to
jump up to hard-to-reach places.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
As soon as you jump into a Baba Bud,
tilt [<][+][>] to align the direction you wish
to jump in.

Once you're in the air, you can use [+][v][^]
to adjust the length of your jump.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You're very talented, Mr. Swordsman!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
See?! If you jump from Baba Bud to Baba
Bud like that, you can gradually make
your way to higher and higher branches.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
We Koroks can fly through the sky using
our own Deku Leaves.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
We Koroks are very light...
You look like you weigh a lot more than
we do. Do you think you'll be all right?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
In order to fly using the Great Deku Tree's
Deku Leaf, you must have magic power.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...You look a lot heavier than us Koroks,
so you probably need a lot of magic...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Now that I think about it, my friend Hollo
is researching potions that replenish
magic power. You should go see him before
you leave here.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Very good, Mr. Swordsman! You've already
mastered using the Deku Leaf!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But...since you're so much heavier than
we are, you can't fly very far, can you? 
How unfortunate...

Well, anyway, this is the exit that leads
to the Forbidden Woods, where our brother,
Makar, is being held.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Please take care of Makar!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You need magic power in order to use the
Deku Leaf to fly. Without magic power, it's
just a useless twig!

You can find Magic Jars hidden in the
grass and vases around here, so be sure to
look for them when you run low.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Congratulations, swordsman!



It appears you've finally gotten the
Deku Leaf!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
That eerie-looking island over there is home
to the Forbidden Woods. Makar is trapped
somewhere within there.

You'll have to float over to the entrance
from here using your Deku Leaf.


But...when you're flying with the Deku Leaf,
you're at the mercy of the wind. If the wind
can't carry you there, you'll fall into the
sea before you land...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If only the wind were blowing in the right
direction to carry you there...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You need lots and lots of magic power to
float from here to the Forbidden Woods.


My friend Olivio is on that tiny plateau
there to the southwest.


You should be able to replenish your magic
power there, so you probably should fly
that way first. If only the wind was blowing
in that direction...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Too bad the wind isn't blowing to the
southwest...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Wow! The wind is blowing just right!



Please! Ride this wind to the southwest and
let it carry you to my friend Olivio.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
First, make sure your Deku Leaf is set to
either [Y], [Z], or [X]. Then just jump from
here and immediately press the button.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Let this wind carry you to my friend
Olivio on the plateau to the southwest!


Please bring Makar back to us!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Nice job, swordsman! It looks like you've
already mastered using your Deku Leaf.
You're a quick study!

The first thing you should do is cut the
grass around here to replenish your
magic power.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The entrance to the Forbidden Woods is
on a much higher level than the entrance
to our Forest Haven.

In order to get up to such a high place,
you'll have to catch the swirling updraft.
Can you see the updraft, swordsman?
The updrafts around here move swiftly.
You have to time your jump just right,
so that the wind will fill your Deku Leaf
and carry you into the updraft, giving you
the lift you need.
Once you're floating on high, just let the
wind take you to the entrance to the woods.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I don't think you can make it to the
Forbidden Woods if the wind isn't blowing
to the northwest...

And that's not all. You also have to catch
the updraft just right...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It would be really helpful if the wind would
just blow to the northwest...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
This is great! The wind is perfect!



I'm amazed, swordsman! You can control
the wind? That's incredible!


Well, now you just need to time your jump
so the wind carries you into the updraft.
Fly, swordsman! To the Forbidden Woods!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But be careful! The monsters flying around
the entrance to the Forbidden Woods might
try to stop you from getting there.

If they do, you can use the Deku Leaf in
midair to fend them off.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Just press the button you set the Deku Leaf
to_[Y], [Z], or [X]_to create a gust of air
that will fend off monsters. Use it to
get by the monsters near the entrance.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Please find Makar!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hello, swordsman! You seem to be in
high spirits!


As for me, I'm using the fruit of the forest
to create potions. I'm called Hollo.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I wish I could create a potion that would
help you, swordsman...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But the ones I have here only seem to work
on my fellow Koroks...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I know!



If you can somehow gain magic power,
swordsman, then you will surely need a
potion that can replenish it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Then_if I can get the right ingredients_
I might be able to make a potion for you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh! But I haven't seen the ingredients that
help recover magic power here in the forest.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If I had seeds from the flower monsters in
the Forbidden Woods, then maybe I could
make a potion for you...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Do you know about those seeds?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I need at least four Boko Baba Seeds
in order to make a potion.


Well, that, and an empty bottle. You
mustn't forget that.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If only I had many of the flower monster
seeds from the Forbidden Woods, then I
could make a potion that replenishes both
life energy and magic power for you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Don't you know about them?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What is that? Did you want me to
do something with it?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh! That's... That's a Boko Baba Seed!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
That's it! That's what I need to make the
kind of super-replenishing potion that
would help you, swordsman!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
That's a Boko Baba Seed, isn't it? If I mix
some of these up, I can make the kind of
super-replenishing potion that would help
you, swordsman!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, but I'd need at least four of these
seeds to make one helping of the potion.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I'm sorry.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
In order to create a potion from Boko Baba
Seeds, I'll need at least four of them.


Return after you collect at least four seeds.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
All right, I'm going to use four of your
seeds to create a super-replenishing potion.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Please wait just a moment.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Onjalla, manjalla, CHO-WAY!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hah hah! It's ready. Here you go.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Come see me again after you gather
more seeds.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I'll be waiting.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, but I can't give you any potion if you
don't have an empty bottle to carry it in.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I'm sorry.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Please come back after you get an
empty bottle to carry the potion in.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Swordsman! Thank you so much for bringing
Makar back to us!


And now that we have completed our
ceremony, I can go back to researching
my potions!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
By the way, did you find any
Boko Baba Seeds?


If you have any, set them to [Y], [Z], or [X]
and show them to me.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Swordsman! Thank you so much for bringing
Makar back to us!


I am Hollo. I make potions from the fruits
of the forest.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Swordsman... Are you the one who
rescued me?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You have my thanks!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
When all went dark around me, I thought
my time on the earth was over.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But...why are you here, swordsman?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What? The Great Deku Tree sent you?!



Oh! Th-That's right! Today's the day of our
annual ceremony!


Oh, I'm in trouble! I shouldn't be here!
I must get out of here immediately!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Let's go! Quickly!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Thank you very much, swordsman. You must
find [?] more of my fellow Koroks.


If you pour that Forest Water on all of our
trees, then the trees will surely grow
strong again.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But remember: in just [?],
the Forest Water you have will turn into
plain water. So hurry up and look for my
fellow Koroks!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The Forest Water you have will turn into
plain water in just [?]. Hurry! Please!
You must find my fellow Koroks!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Swordsman! Come see how healthy my
forest tree has become! Wow! I'm so happy!
Thank you so much!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You should return once this tree has spread
its roots to create a large forest.


I'm certain it will be quite beautiful.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
That's too bad...
Your Forest Water turned into plain water
before you were able to pour it on all of
the wilting trees.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You have to water all the trees before the
Forest Water loses its life-giving power.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The Great Deku Tree probably knows where
the rest of my fellow Koroks are.


Please bring Forest Water for my tree
once again.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hello, swordsman. I haven't seen you in
a while. How have you been?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I've come here to plant the Great Deku
Tree's seed...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But look!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Usually, the forest trees sprout quite
vigorously wherever you plant them, but
for some reason, this one has withered...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...I'd be willing to bet that the trees
my fellow Koroks have planted are
withering, as well.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It seems that when one tree fails to grow
from its seed, all the forest trees from
that year's seeds wither and fail to grow
tall and mighty.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What are we to do? If we are not able to
nurse these trees to health, the forest will
never spread, and the Great Deku Tree will
slowly wither and die...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...



Maybe if we could sprinkle the water from
the Forest Haven on the tree... Maybe then
this sapling would be saved.

That water is the wellspring of the Great
Deku Tree's life force.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Swordsman! Could you go to the Forest
Haven and get some of the water that flows
around the Great Deku Tree?

Could you get some and sprinkle it on this
poor forest tree?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Please? Please help me!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I will do what I can here to make sure this
forest tree does not wither any further.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Please, swordsman, go to the Forest Haven
and bring back some of the Forest Water.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Can you please help me?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hello, swordsman! I haven't seen you in a
while. How have you been?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Huh?



You say the forest trees my fellow Koroks
have planted are withering?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So, it's true! As you can see, the forest
tree I have planted is doing the same.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I can't help but think that this, too, is the
result of Ganondorf's evil plot. Could it be?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...Regardless, in order to bring the life
back into this poor withered sapling,
I will certainly need Forest Water.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Swordsman! Could you please go to the
Forest Haven and bring back some of the
water that flows around the Great Deku
Tree? Could you sprinkle it on this tree?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Please? I beg of you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Please, Mr. Swordsman. Could you please
go get Forest Water once more and take it
to all eight of the Koroks who guard the
withered forest trees?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The tree is withering...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You poured Forest Water on it, but it still
has not recovered all of its vigor.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The tree has recovered all of its vigor!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You already have Forest Water in
your bottle.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Your Forest Water has become plain water.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, Makar! You have returned safely!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I'm sorry, Great Deku Tree...



I know you warned us many times, but
still I did not listen...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Do not worry, Makar. You are safe now.
Just be more careful from now on.
You have done well, [player_name]. I must
thank you for your brave deeds.
Here is that which I have promised you.
Please accept it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It is my hope that this pearl shall lead you
to a fair destiny!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
All is well, Makar. Do not cry.



Please... Play your songs for me as you
always do.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, that's right! We must begin our
ceremony soon, before the day ends!


I'm sorry to keep you all waiting.
Let the ceremony begin!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, Great [player_name]...



As my thanks to you, I shall play even
harder than I normally do.


I hope you enjoy it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Great Deku Tree! This year you have once
again produced some splendid seeds!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
With these seeds, we will continue to
spread new forests across the Great Sea.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Let us go, Koroks! To the sea!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
See you all next year!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Take care!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Farewell, great swordsman!
May the winds of chance bring us together
again someday!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Thank you, [player_name], for all that
you've done for me.


How was my performance? Did it suit your
tastes or no?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
This instrument is the one the Great Deku
Tree gave to me on the day of my birth.


He said it is an instrument that people
played long, long ago. It has taken many
long hours of practice for me to be able
to perform at the level I do now.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Eight of my fellow Koroks have set out on
journeys to create new forests in the world.


But both Hollo, who studies the making of
potions, and I are always on this island.
Please come to see us here again. We'll be
waiting for you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I'm going to practice much more so that
next year's performance will be spectacular.


I hope you'll come back to see us again
then. You will, won't you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh! [player_name]! I haven't seen you in
quite some time, have I?


I'm surprised you were able to find me here.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hmm? You're wondering why I'm all the
way down here?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I'm practicing a new song for next year's
ceremony. And I need privacy!


It isn't any fun if everyone knows in
advance what song I'll play.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What? You can hear my song outside?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ruh-really...?
I thought the sound of the waves would
drown it out...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Perhaps I should play a little more softly
when I practice from now on.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Please, if you don't mind, keep the fact
that I'm practicing here a secret. I don't
want everyone to know about it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Why, is that a conductor's baton?



[player_name]! Are you a maestro?!



That's incredible!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Are you going to conduct for me,
[player_name]?


What kind of song is it? I can't wait to
hear it! Please, conduct!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh! Are you going to conduct for me again?



Ooh, I can't wait! This will be so much fun!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hmmm... That's a nice song.



Is that it? My songs are better than that...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh! I'm sorry! Did you hear that? I guess
that was kind of rude!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Huh? Are you done? Oh, that's too bad.
I was looking forward to your song.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hmmm... Does it go something like...this?



Strange... Why does it feel like I already
know this song..?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name]...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
This sacred song that you've conducted has
awakened me... I know myself now!
I am the sage of the Wind Temple...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It is my fate to return the power to repel
evil to your Master Sword.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...And to ease the regrets of my ancestors.
Oh, [player_name], please! You must take
me with you to the Wind Temple.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name], I have fully restored the
power to repel evil to your Master Sword.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...And my ancestors are most satisfied.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I shall continue praying to the gods here.



[player_name], please step into the light
and return above ground.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
May the winds of fortune be at your back.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ohhh... Owwww...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name]! You're all right?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What is this place...?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hey! And Ganondorf!
What happened to him?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name]! What are you doing?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You must come now to the room where you
got the Master Sword!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Who is using that stone...?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Just who are you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name] and I are the only ones who
can speak through this stone!


How dare you use what's not yours?!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...Your name is Tetra, correct?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You must come with [player_name] to see
me at once!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hmph! Well, don't you sound important!
...Fine. We're on our way. Just hold
your horses, whoever you are.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name], what are you waiting for?
You heard the stone. You're supposed to
show me how to get to where that voice is!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Are you him? Are you the one who was
speaking through my stone without my
permission? Answer me!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
That stone is an enhanced version of the
Gossip Stones long spoken of in the legends
of the Hyrulian Royal Family. I am the one
who made it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You made it?
The royal family's Gossip Stone?


I'm sorry, but I have no idea what you're
talking about.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Have neither of you heard the tales?



Tales of the kingdom spoken of in the
legend of the great hero... The place where
the power of the gods lies hidden...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
This place, where the two of you now
stand, is that kingdom.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
And I am its king:
Daphnes Nohansen Hyrule.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name], do you not recognize
my voice?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Indeed, I am the one who guided you here.
I am the King of Red Lions.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
There was no need for me to reveal my true
identity to you so long as that blade,
the Master Sword, could defeat Ganon...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But now...both of you must listen to me.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Once, long ago, this land of Hyrule was
turned into a world of shadows by Ganon,
who sought to obtain the power of the
gods for his own evil ends.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
My power alone could not stop the fiend,
and our only choice was to leave the fate
of the kingdom in the hands of the gods...

When the gods heard our pleas, they chose
to seal away not only Ganon, but Hyrule
itself...and so, with a torrential downpour
of rains from the heavens...
Our fair kingdom was soon buried beneath
the waves, forgotten at the bottom of
the ocean.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yet all was not lost. For the gods knew
that to seal the people away with the
kingdom would be to grant Ganon's wish
for the destruction of the land.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So, before the sealing of the kingdom,
the gods chose those who would build a
new country and commanded them to take
refuge on the mountaintops.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Those people were your ancestors.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hundreds of years have passed since then...



So long as Ganondorf was not revived,
Hyrule would remain below, never waking
from its slumber.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Tetra, come to me.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
This necklace you wear is part of a sacred
treasure called the Triforce of Wisdom,
which has been passed down for many ages
within the royal family of Hyrule.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Your mother passed this down to you and
instructed you to treasure it...and to guard
it with your life.

Am I not correct?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The Triforce of Wisdom is none other than
the sacred power of the gods that we have
kept from Ganon's clutches for so many
long years.
The gods placed upon your ancestors the
task of protecting it from evil's grasp.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You, too, must abide by the laws of the
past...and so the time has come for me to
teach you the fate into which you were
born, the very reason that you live.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
My...fate...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You are the true heir of the royal family of
Hyrule...the last link in the bloodline.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...Zelda? I'm...a princess?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You are confused, aren't you?
I suppose such is to be expected.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name]!



I am terribly sorry that you have been
caught up in these events.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But now that it is known that Tetra is
indeed Princess Zelda...


Ganon will be searching frantically for this
child in an attempt to get the power of the
gods that she possesses. He will not rest
until he has found her.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If he succeeds, my ancient kingdom under
the sea will be turned into a land of
shadow and despair...and so will the world
you know above the waves.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name], I need you to lend me your
strength in this dark hour.


I have a suspicion about what has caused
the Master Sword to lose its power.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I need for you to come with me back to the
lands above the water and return the
power to repel evil to the Master Sword!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Zelda...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It is far too dangerous for you to join us in
this task.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Fortunately, this sacred chamber is not yet
known to Ganon.


It is my wish that you wait here in hiding
until we return.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name]! We must go!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name]...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Everything that's happened to you and
your poor sister...
It's all been my fault.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...I'm so sorry.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name]...



Be careful...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name], listen well...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The fact that the Master Sword lost the
power to repel evil suggests to me that
something has happened to the sages who
infused the blade with the gods' power.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The sages should be here in Hyrule...in the
Wind Temple to the north and the Earth
Temple to the south, praying to the gods.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You must head for these two temples to see
what has happened to the sages and
attempt to find a way to recover the
power to repel evil.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Unfortunately, Ganon seems to have erected
some sort of magical barrier down here in
Hyrule, blocking our path to the temples.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But...each temple should have another
entrance high upon Hyrule's mountaintops,
which are now islands above the sea.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
As always, I shall mark these places
on your Sea Chart.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Now then... If we stay here much longer,
we shall draw our enemy's attention to
Princess Zelda's whereabouts. We must
return to the surface immediately!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name], do you know the legend
of the Hero of Time?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Once, long ago, he defeated Ganon and
brought peace to the Kingdom of Hyrule...


A piece of the Triforce was given to the
Hero of Time and he kept it safe, much as
Zelda kept hers.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
That sacred piece is known as the
Triforce of Courage.


When the Hero of Time was called to
embark on another journey and left the
land of Hyrule, he was separated from the
elements that made him a hero.
It is said that at that time, the Triforce of
Courage was split into eight shards and
hidden throughout the land.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It seems you already have some knowledge
of these shards...


If you are able to collect all of them, they
will fuse together and complete the piece of
the Triforce, once again opening the
passage through the waves to Hyrule.
You must search for the remaining shards.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Even I do not know where they rest, but
this much I do know: they lie hidden
somewhere in this Great Sea.

The Triforce of Courage is the only key that
will once again open the doorway to Hyrule.


You must search for it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You have done well, [player_name].
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It would seem the gods have acknowledged
you to be a true hero.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But this does not mean your trials have
ended here...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Once you take your first step into the world
beyond the ring of light you see shimmering
in the waves before you...

Your true trial will begin.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Are you ready, [player_name]?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Then hang on tightly!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You are probably wondering where we are,
aren't you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Unfortunately, there is not enough time for
me to explain it to you now...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Once you are able to strike down Ganon
with the item you obtain in this castle...


...All will be made clear to you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Trust in my words! See what awaits you
in the castle!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name], it is still too early for you
to come to this place.


Even though the power to repel evil has
been returned to the Master Sword, you
will not be able to return to Hyrule
until the Triforce is complete.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Quickly! You must now think only of finding
the eight shards and completing the
Triforce of Courage.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You cannot defeat Ganon until the power to
repel evil has been returned to the
Master Sword.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I, too, am worried about Zelda, as you are...



But for now, you must focus on recovering
the Master Sword's power.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hurry, [player_name]!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Well done, [player_name]. You must show
the Triforce piece you have assembled to
the gods.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh! What is this? There, on your hand_the
Triforce piece now dwells within you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It is the Triforce of Courage_proof
that you are indeed the true hero.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You have controlled the wind and crossed
the seas, and here, near the end of your
quest, the power of the gods has been
bestowed upon you...
Surely, from this moment on, you shall be
known as the Hero of Winds...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name]! Hero of Winds!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Go forth!



To Hyrule! To Zelda's side!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You have done well to find your way
to this place.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, chosen one...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Accept this final challenge...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The path can now be opened.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, chosen one...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What will now come to pass is tied to your
fate_to the path that you have chosen.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Go forward with caution.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name]?
[player_name], is that you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It is! I'm pleased to see you're OK.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I must say...



You've traveled far for one with no wings...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
And your sister? Is she...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Is that so?
Well, don't worry too much.
I'm sure she'll hang in there.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I have an idea, [player_name].
Would you like to meet our chieftain?


I've told my people here about you, and
all of us Rito are very concerned.


I'm certain the chieftain will befriend you
and lend you the aid of our aerie.


It's settled, then! I'll fly on ahead and let
everyone know you're coming.


Come inside, [player_name]!



I'll be waiting!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Well? Have you discovered the cause of
the great Valoo's anger?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ah. So, you are [player_name], are you?



Quill has told me all about you.



A troubling tale, indeed...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I insist that you let us know if there is
anything we can do to help you.


We shall do everything in our power to
assist you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
However, in the meantime, we have a
problem of our own to deal with...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
When you arrived on the island, did you
notice the raging dragon perched atop
the mountain?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
As you can see, we of the Rito tribe are
profoundly connected to the sky. We make
our livings on the airways.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
We do so by the graces of the sky spirit,
Valoo. When a Rito reaches adulthood, he
or she journeys to the top of Dragon Roost
to receive a scale from the great dragon.
It is this scale that enables the Rito to
grow his or her wings.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Recently, however, the once-gentle Valoo
has grown violent and unpredictable.


Sadly, we can no longer approach him.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If this continues, the fledglings who are of
age will never be able to receive scales
from Valoo on Dragon Roost.

They will remain wingless, and in time,
our very way of life will be threatened.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
As chieftain of the Rito, my first
responsibility is to solve this problem.


My apologies, but I must ask you to wait
for our assistance until this is done.
Will you do so?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Chieftain, what do you think of consulting
[player_name] with regards to your son,
Prince Komali?

As you can see, [player_name] is a
gallant young lad!


I feel certain that Prince Komali would
open his heart to him and speak freely
of his fears and worries.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
That may be...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Let me be direct. My son, Komali, is of the
age to earn his wings...


Yet...he is weak, in some ways...and in light
of the current situation, he may just give
up on ever getting them...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What say you?



Will you share some of your courage
with my son?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Will you meet with my son?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I thank you!



We shall do our best to solve our problem
as quickly as possible, so that we may
better help you with yours.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I have something I wish for you to give to
my son.


A young girl named Medli is holding it for
me. Would you find her and take it?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I am counting on you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Here, [player_name], take this with you!



Who knows? It might come in handy.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You should find Medli in one of the
upper rooms.


Leave the great Valoo to us.



In the meanwhile, do your best to aid
Prince Komali!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ah, [player_name]!
I hoped I would get the chance to thank
you in person.

Medli told me everything. I am extremely
grateful for all that you have done.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It seems you have helped my son, Komali,
find his courage, as well.


You have done so much for us!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I thank you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Tell us if there is anything the Rito can do
for you. Anything at all.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I believe your journey is far from over,
but no matter where you may go, we can
still reach you.

As you travel from island to island, be sure
to check the local postbox.


We shall be sure to deliver any letters or
packages addressed to you to the postbox
nearest to you.

Keep your eyes peeled for the moving
postboxes, for they have mail within them. 

I trust that is clear.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
We will deliver any letters or packages
addressed to you to the postbox nearest
you. Without fail, I promise you.

You may continue your journey knowing this
to be true.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ah, [player_name]!
I hoped I would get the chance to thank
you in person.

Medli told me everything. I am extremely
grateful for all that you have done.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It seems you have helped my son, Komali,
find his courage, as well.


You have done so much for us!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I thank you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
By the way, are you using our postboxes?



Well, as you might know, since you left the
island, all letters and packages addressed
to you have been delivered to whatever
postbox was nearest you.
Of course, the system is not perfect_you
tend to move around a lot. So be sure to
check any moving postboxes you find in
your travels. Do not forget!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
We shall deliver any letters or packages
addressed to you to the postbox nearest
your location.

You may continue your journey knowing this
to be true.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ah, [player_name]!
So you have returned safely.


May I assume that you have been checking
our postboxes?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Since you left, our island has been beset
by a plague of monsters, which appear
after the setting of the sun.

Luckily, they have never come during
daylight hours, so you may rest safely. 
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
As you can see, when the sun goes down,
monsters appear outside...


Do not worry: the aerie's borders are
well protected, and they cannot get in here.
Please go and rest yourself.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Make yourself at home.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ah, [player_name]!
It is good to see that you are looking
so hale and hearty.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Relax and rest your weary spirit.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Wow! You really DO have green clothes and
a strange-shaped hat...


You're [player_name], aren't you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, me? I'm an attendant to the great sky
spirit, Valoo. My name is Medli.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Well, to tell the truth...
I'm not an attendant quite yet. I'm actually
still studying to be one.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, what am I thinking? Here! This is from
the chieftain.


[player_name], he wants you to give this
directly to Prince Komali.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The room way in the back on the first floor
is Prince Komali's room. You have to go
down a couple steps to get there.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
By the way, ummmm...
Listen, [player_name]...


I have a small favor I'd like to ask
of you...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Could you please come to the entrance of
Dragon Roost Cavern later?


...I'll explain everything then.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
After you've spoken to Prince Komali,
please come to the entrance of Dragon
Roost Cavern. It's really important.

I'll explain everything then, I promise.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name]!
You came to rescue me!


Oh, thank you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I have to tell you what I found out!
This is terrible!


...Some creature is doing awful things to
the great Valoo's tail!


That's why he's so angry!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The great Valoo's tail hangs down into the
room right below here.


There's got to be something in there...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I wonder if those mean monsters who
captured me have something to do with it...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
We've got to do something! Now! Before it's
too late!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I'll go and tell everyone what's happening!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Here, [player_name]!
Use this to get out of here!


It's what I used to get this far.



It's a device we Rito used before we
evolved wings.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Here, [player_name]. Climb up on that
little ledge over there, so I can show
you something.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Grab this branch with the Grappling Hook
and you can swing over there to get out
of this area!

When you aim at a branch that you can
latch onto, [Target lock mark] will appear. Remember that!


Don't you worry about me, [player_name].
Get going!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hey, you actually came!



I'm really sorry for bringing you to such a
dangerous place. I had to! I wouldn't have
asked if I didn't need help desperately.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You see this place? There used to be a
spring here, surrounded by a beautiful
pond... It was peaceful and lovely...

But then the great Valoo...
He became so angry, and...


In his rage, he shook the mountain and this
boulder crashed down, plugging the spring.
You can see the result.

Oh, but where is my mind? Tell me,
how was Prince Komali?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh... That doesn't sound right... Not at all...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I may be partially to blame for the bad
turn that Prince Komali's taken...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
See, Prince Komali's grandmother was the
great Valoo's former attendant.


She was an amazing woman. I was honored
to have her as my teacher...


She was kind and brave, and unsurpassed
in her dealings with the great Valoo.
I'm not yet worthy of being mentioned
in the same breath as her.
If only I'd possessed some of her strength,
I'm sure Prince Komali would have felt
more secure.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name], I'm sorry to ask this...
but I need your help!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I want to go to the small shrine that's
near the peak of Dragon Roost, but that
ledge over there is so high...

If I could get some wind under my wings,
I'm sure I could get up there.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Will you help me?
Sure
I don't think so
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, please? I wouldn't ask if it wasn't
important! It's just that...I'm not that good
at flying yet...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Whew... Thank you so much!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
OK, pick me up.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Then face that ledge and toss me!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The atmospheric currents are really messed
up, so pay close attention to the direction
of the wind.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
All right, I'm ready!
Don't hold back, now!
Throw me as hard as you can!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I'm... I'm fiiiine! That...didn't really hurt.
What was I saying? Oh, yeah! Once...
Once more! With the wind! Toss away!
Please!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
OK, that didn't exactly work.
Let's try once more. Use the wind and
throw me up to that ledge!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, thank goodness!



I had a bad feeling that you weren't going
to come back, [player_name].
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Remember, use the wind to launch me up to
the top of that ledge!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, thank you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I think now I'll be able to climb Dragon
Roost and meet with the great Valoo!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Don't worry, I'll be fine!



I may be just an apprentice attendant, but
I can understand some of the great
Valoo's language.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I'm not exactly bursting with confidence, but...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Look, if anything happens to me...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Please look after Prince Komali!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
This is all I have to give you. I know it's
not much, but please take it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, and please don't tell anyone that I'm
climbing Dragon Roost!


It'll be our secret, OK?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Well, good luck!


...To both of us.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
When you meet Prince Komali, please don't
get offended by his manner.


He has no bad intentions, I promise.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Huh? Who are you supposed to be?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What do you want from me, huh?
I... I don't want to talk to anyone right now!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What do you want me to do with that, huh?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
A letter?
From my father?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, sure, telling me to be brave is easy
enough for him...


It's not like he's the one who went through
that horrible experience... It's not like HE
still has to go get a scale from Valoo.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You're in this letter, too, you know...



Poking your nose in other people's
business... You're nosy, aren't you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Sorry, but I really don't feel like going to
see Valoo right now.


I mean, how am I supposed to get a scale
from him when he's so upset?

What? Are you trying to say that YOU can
calm Valoo down?


Psssssh! That's just a big, fat lie!
It's easy to SAY you can do anything!
Bragging doesn't cost a thing!

I'll tell you what: If you can find me
someone who can get past all the obstacles
on Dragon Roost to get to Valoo...

THEN I'll listen to anything you say!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, this...?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It's strange... Holding this calms me down.
I forget all the bad things.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It's so pretty, isn't it? It's called Din's
Pearl. My grandma gave it to me.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
My grandma used to be Valoo's attendant.
She was the only person on the island who
understood Valoo's language.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, Grandma... If she were here, I know she
could calm Valoo down. I just know it...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But my father and the rest? No matter how
hard they try...they'll fail. I know it.


No one else can calm Valoo down.
It's impossible...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What? What is it, huh?
Listen, you can stare all you want, but
I'm not giving this to you.

This is MY treasure. You understand?



I'm not going to just hand it over to some
do-nothing guy, am I?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You can stop staring any time now!
I'm not giving this to you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
There's no one out there who can get Valoo
to settle down...so just go away and let
me be miserable by myself.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Master [player_name], you really helped
us out of a pickle!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Am I right, Akoot?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You could not be MORE right, Skett!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You saved our tailfeathers!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Master [player_name], I must thank you so
very much!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What are you, mute, Skett? Could you not
show a little appreciation?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I am working on it, Akoot!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Er... Thank you oh so very much.
Take care of yourself.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I believe that Prince Komali has gone to
Dragon Roost to study.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Is that not right?
Akoot! Look alive!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yes! Yes, of course! I deem you are
absolutely correct, Skett.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
He told us to give you his regards,
Master [player_name].
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Master [player_name], Medli is busy with
her attendant studies.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Is that not correct, Skett?
...Skett?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, that is quite correct, Akoot!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Please come back and see her some
other time.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Master [player_name], I believe that
Prince Komali has gone out...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Am I right or am I right, Akoot?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I believe you are right, Skett.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
He should be returning before too much
longer, so do not worry.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Master [player_name], if you are looking
for Medli, I believe she is atop the cliff
just outside.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Do I speak the truth, Skett?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You do, Akoot, as usual! She is right in the
same old spot!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If you step outside near where she is,
you should be able to hear the song she
is playing.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Master [player_name], do not push yourself
too hard.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Akoot! Speak up! Is there nothing you want
to say to Master [player_name]?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Of course there is, Skett!
And that something is as follows...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Do your best!
We are with you all the way!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Master [player_name], you know Medli,
do you not?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Well, we cannot find her!
I am not lying, am I, Skett?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You most certainly are not, Akoot!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Now, I do not think there is any need for
alarm, but let us know if you see her.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
As you're from off-island, allow me tell
you about the Dragon Roost. Even in the
best of times, it's a dangerous place with
all those bomb flowers growing everywhere.
...And now, it's even more perilous. It's so
bad that the bomb flowers themselves have
all dried up. The "great and wonderful
Valoo" has created quite a mess!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
We used to have to worry only about bomb
flowers when we went to get our scales.


Now, climbing's not even an issue since we
can't even get close to the mountain.
You think I'm joking? Go and take a look
for yourself.
The bomb flowers that marked the entrance
to Dragon Roost Cavern have all wilted
because the earth is so dry. They're not
producing bomb-fruit at all. It's sad, really.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I guess it's to be expected in this heat, but
just take a look down there!
Dragon Roost Pond is completely dried up!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The pond came from this bubbling spring.
It was such a beautiful little pond...


Now it's so arid that even the bomb flowers
have completely dried up.


It's just so hot...
I'm sure the chieftain and those guys are
having a tough time checking things out,
but it's tough for us guards, too.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name], do you know Medli?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Just now, some fellow told me that he
saw some unfamiliar creatures near
Dragon Roost Cavern...

He said that they grabbed a girl that
looked like Medli...


...Which is odd, because I know Medli can't
fly well enough to get to the Dragon Roost
Cavern entrance by herself. So I figure it
must be some sort of mix-up.
It IS a bit disconcerting, though...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
This whole business of someone resembling
Medli getting snatched near Dragon Roost
Cavern has got to some kind of mistake.

Still, I'm going to wait here for a while and
watch things extra-carefully.


Don't worry, [player_name].



Just look after Prince Komali.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
We used to have such nice breezes blowing
through here... Now the air is crazy.


I'm positive the strange winds are a result
of the wind god's anger.


See, there's an important shrine below here
that got broken...and now we're paying
the price. What cursed luck...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
We Rito cannot live without the wind.



Before we take to the skies, we always go
down and visit the wind god's shrine.
That's the way it's always been.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Every year, the Rito sponsor a Bird-Man
Contest on that island off to the east.


I wonder if we'll have one this year, what
with the current situation on the island...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
No time to waste!



Everyone's so busy with the great Valoo
that we're running short of delivery
personnel. It's a mad-house!

Ah, well, back to work!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If you want to get to Dragon Roost Cavern,
I've got some bad news for you...


The bridge is out. There's no way to even
get inside. I'm sure you'll understand
once you've seen it for yourself.

As for swimming across, well...
You need water for that, and the pond's
all dried up...

No need to panic, though! I'm sure the
chieftain will think of something.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Sorry to tell you this, but you can no longer
get to Dragon Roost Cavern. Even if you
were of a mind to swim across, the pond's
empty. That's right, it's bone dry...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Dragon Roost just up and stopped shaking!



I wonder if this means the great Valoo's
feeling better...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
This is great news for the fledglings!
Now they can climb Dragon Roost and get
their scales!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Long time, no see.



How've you been?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Please, make yourself at home.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Long time, no see.



How've you been?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Don't want to stay outside, huh?



Well, make yourself at home.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I was just thinking that it hasn't been quite
so hot lately, and what do you know?
The pond's gone back to normal!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The pond's filled up again! We've got to get
busy repairing the bridge!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hey! Welcome back!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Apparently there are still some weird things
up on Dragon Roost.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, it's you...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The night's full of dangers, you know.
It's better to stay inside.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You can hear that song coming from up on
the cliff, can't you?


Mmmm... Such beautiful tone.
Medli's really gotten good.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The top of that cliff is Medli's special spot.



That girl really is a hard worker. She's
beginning to fill the shoes of her teacher.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Wasn't Medli on top of that cliff outside?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It's starting to get dark... Could you go and
tell her it's time to come inside?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It appears that the great Valoo is in much
better spirits.


Maybe we'll have our annual Bird-Man
Contest after all.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ah, I'm off to do some more work!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
We're holding our traditional Bird-man
Contest on that little island over there.
Why don't you give it a try?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Maybe I'll go ahead and take a break
myself...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You can go ahead and take a look at
Dragon Roost if you want.


They're still assessing the situation, though,
so I wouldn't go inside.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
They're still checking to see if Dragon
Roost is safe. Wait just a bit more, please.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ah, I heard of your trials. Nicely done.
You must be weary!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Be careful out there...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ah, nicely done. You must be weary!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It's dangerous out at night, so be
extra-careful.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
There appear to be markings that indicate
specific directions.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It's broken...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yep! That's a miiiiiighty nice breeze!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The name's Zephos.
I'm the god of winds.


So, you're the new Wind Waker, are you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Great, great. For a beginner, you've got a
nice wind-sense about you.
I like you, kid!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
That tune you just picked up?
Well, it gives you control over the direction
the wind blows.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Depending on how it's used, wind can be a
good thing...or a very bad thing. You want
an example of it being a bad thing, then
you should see my brother.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It saddens me to say that my brother,
Cyclos, is miffed about his monument here
being broken, and now he spends his time
creating cyclones to torment people with.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So if you encounter any cyclones at sea,
chastise my brother for me, will you?


And THAT...is my request for you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
That's a heck of an arm you've got there!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
And what an eye! No one's ever been able
to spot me in there before now!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You obviously have mastery of the air.
And now that we've established that you're
quite the Wind Waker...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Let's see if you can handle this!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Bah! What's wrong? So! You can't keep up
with marvelous me after all, can you?
Oh, all right! Fine! I'll show it to
you one more time!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Waaaaa-hoooooooooooooo!



In the hands of a Wind Waker like you,
my adorable little cyclones will be as
happy as can be!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If you need to move like the wind over the
ocean deeps, just call on my cyclones!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Well, I guess I'll head for home now!
See you on down the road!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name]!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Well, Prince Komali? Don't you have
something you want to say?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Um, I heard everything from Medli...



[player_name]... Thank you so much!
I'm sorry I mistrusted you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I hope I can be like you someday,
[player_name].
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You will, Komali! I just know it!
Right, [player_name]?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So, [player_name]? ...Here!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I want you to take this, [player_name]!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Giving you the thing I value most will
give me the courage I need to stand up to
bad things!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The great Valoo is grateful to you,
[player_name].
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
O Hero! Thank you!
O Hero! Use the wind god's wind!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Use the wind god's...wind?



That's what he said, but I don't understand.
I wonder what it means?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The wind god's wind... I wonder if what
he's talking about has anything to do with
the Wind Shrine that's through that tunnel...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, I almost forgot! The great Valoo also
names you, [player_name], a true hero.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I agree with him. As far as we're concerned,
[player_name], you really ARE a hero!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Well, I'm going to go and visit Valoo!



I'll come and see you sometime_with the
best pair of wings ever!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hey! Prince Komali!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Thanks so much, [player_name].



See you again someday!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hey! I know you! Yeah!



You're the adventure guy. Sailing from
island to island. Action! Excitement! Right?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So, with all the adventuring you do...
Did you happen to find a Golden Feather?


My girlfriend, she's wanted one of those
things for the longest time.


And actually, I kind of promised that I'd
send one to her...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I have no idea why she wants a Golden
Feather, but you know how it is...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It doesn't matter why, really. I just want to
see her happy. To see her smile, you know?


...Which is why I told her I'd send her one...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I don't get to see her very often, and I know
she's been a bit lonely...


I just want to make her happy.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I'm really rooting for you, adventure-guy!
Get out there and do your best!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I'm going to write a letter right away and
send this off!


Wow! I'm really excited! And if I'm excited,
then SHE'LL be ECSTATIC!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Aw, wow! That's spectacular!
Are you going to let me have it?


You really are a good guy, aren't you?
The best!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hey! That's what my girlfriend wants!
A Golden Feather!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So, how many of those do you have?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yeah, well, when you get 20 of those,
would you let me have them? I know she
only wanted one, but if I give my girl
20 of them, I'll be loving life!
I'd like to get out and gather them on my
own, but...


Well, you know, I've got guard duty and all.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So, are you really going to let me have
20 of those?
Sure
I don't think so
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I guess I understand...
That's a bit too many, isn't it?


But I promised, and...I want to be able
to keep my word!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Really? Are you sure? Yessss!



I'm going to stick these little beauties in a
letter and send them off right away!


I'm going to tell her all about you, too!
I'm so happy! Seriously!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It's not much, but please accept this.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Whoa! You've got some cool stuff!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Dear [player_name],
 I recently received some Golden Feathers
 from my boyfriend, who mentioned you.

 I'm something of a bird enthusiast, so I
 know how hard it must've been to get all
 of these feathers.

 I want you to be as happy as we are,
 [player_name], so I'm sending you this
 [?] as a token of our affection.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You got a Piece of Heart!
Collect four to form one Heart
Container. More Heart Containers
mean more life energy! How exciting!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, [player_name]!
You're OK!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You know, Prince Komali's been asking me
all about your adventures, [player_name].
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I can rest easy now that I've seen you safe
and sound with my own eyes.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Prince Komali's turned into a fine young
adult, hasn't he?


Recently, he's even begun doing things on
his own, without my guidance.


...Every conversation still ends up centered
on you, though, [player_name].

Watching Prince Komali grow up fills me
with pride...but it makes me a little sad,
as well...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I wonder if this is how a mother feels...


¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, but just listen to me go on!
How weird I must sound!
Hee hee...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Well, I'd better continue practicing so that I
can be useful around here, too!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Performing music like this is an important
duty of an attendant.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
This instrument is called one of fate's tools.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Prince Komali's grandmother saw me
carrying it one day and called out to
me to stop. She'd seen my fate in the
curves of the instrument, you see.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
She eventually became my teacher, and
that's how I became the attendant you
see before you today.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So, now you understand why I need to hurry
and improve my skills, so that I may help
the aerie.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hey, is that the Wind Waker?! Wow!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name], will you conduct me?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I wonder how I'll do...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What song shall we perform?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Incredible, [player_name]!



How was my performance?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name], let's play another song.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Are you finished? Is that it?
Oh, that's too bad.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
For [?], I'll pay [?]!



You sure you want to sell?
Yes
Maybe not
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hmm... What a mysterious song...
It sounds so...familiar.


It's almost as if something I've forgotten
is trying to be remembered...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh... I feel...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Just now, a sage spoke to me.
She spoke so gently...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
There's something...something that
I must do.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name]...



Thanks to you, I've been awakened to the
knowledge that I'm a sage of the
Earth Temple.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
There's actually something that I can do to
help this world. It's incredible...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I bet my teacher knew all about this...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name], please... You must take me
to the Earth Temple.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
We must hurry and wake the power to repel
evil that sleeps within the Master Sword.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Let's go now, quickly and quietly.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, Komali... I just want him to remember
me as a simple attendant...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name], the power to repel evil is
not yet fully awakened.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
To complete the awakening of the Master
Sword, you must go to the Wind Temple for
one more prayer.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Now, [player_name]...



Step into the light behind you and return to
the surface. Your next duty is to find the
sage of the Wind Temple.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I will remain here and continue to pray.



You must hurry!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...And [player_name]!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Um... About Prince Komali...
Please watch over him for me.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Well, now! I've not seen your young face
before. Nope. Don't believe so.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hmm?



You wouldn't be here in response to our
posting for some part-time help, would you?


Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
No? Well, too bad for us, I guess.
Can't say I'm happy to hear that.


With everyone out patrolling the island at
night, we've been a bit shorthanded.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
No? Well, that's not any kind of good
news. In fact, it's bad.


The thing is, this hoopla with the great
Valoo has left me without enough help.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ooh, excellent. That's good. But first,
to see if I can use you or not, I need to
give you a little test. Just a small one.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Match the seal on the envelope with the
same icon on the shelf and throw the letter
onto that shelf. Real easy. Simple.

Use [+] to select a shelf and press [A] to
throw a letter. Like I said: simple.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Is that clear?
Sure
Not really
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
OK, now listen up...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Before time runs out, you have to sort at
least ten letters!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Give it your best shot!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[var. # letters sorted] letters! Great! Good! Terrific!



You pass!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
OK, you get one Rupee for every two letters,
so that comes to a grand total of [var. # rupees reward for sorting],
am I right?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Come back anytime. I mean it. Anytime.
The more letters you sort, the more you'll
earn! Not a bad deal. For both of us.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hmm, not even one... Shocking. Crazy.



Sorry, but it seems you're not cut out for
this sort of work. You can always try again
some other time, though. It's almost
guaranteed you'll do better than this.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
One letter... Yikes.



Sorry, but it seems you're not cut out for
this sort of work. You can always try again
some other time, though. I'm sure you'll do
better than this.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[var. # letters sorted] letters... Too bad. Unfortunate.



Luck wasn't with you this time, I'm afraid.
Try again some other time.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Are you looking for work?
Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
No?



Well, we're looking for help, so tell anyone
you know who needs work, will you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Are you looking for work?
Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, I see... Disappointing. Sad.
Think it over, will you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You've got spirit! Excellent! Great!



Well, I'm going to give you that simple
test again... You know the drill.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________

________________________________________
You got that, right?
Uh-huh
Nope
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hey! You ready for work?
Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, OK... I suppose I understand.
Well, stop by again when you have time!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You already understand what you need to
do, am I right?
Yup
Nope

________________________________________
Now you've got it, right?
Sure do
Nope
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You still don't get it?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
OK! If you can sort 20 or more letters,
you'll see some nice financial gain!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Go ahead and get started.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
That's [var. # letters sorted] letters! Splendid! Super!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hmm... Your salary this time is one Rupee
per letter, so I need to pay you [var. # rupees reward for sorting].
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Come on by anytime. I mean it. Anytime.



The better you do, the higher your salary
will become! That's economics.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What? You didn't even get one? That's sort
of distressing. Disturbing. Bad.


Are you feeling a bit under the weather?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ooh... Only one letter... That's really
not very good. Poor. Substandard.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Too bad. Really, just unfortunate.
You have to sort fifteen letters or more
or you don't get paid.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[var. # letters sorted] letters.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Let's see... I owe you one Rupee for every

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You need some work?
Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If you can sort twenty-five letters or more,
your salary will really jump! I mean it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
All right! Get to work!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[var. # letters sorted] letters!
You have amazing coordination!


Seriously, I'm stupefied! Incredulous!
We veterans do this all day long, and even
we have a hard time reaching that amount!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I've got to give you more money! Got to!



Three Rupees per letter comes to [var. # rupees reward for sorting].
How's that sound?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hey, your name wouldn't happen to be
[player_name], would it?


It is, isn't it?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Mmm-hmm. I thought you looked like the
lad the chieftain was talking about.


In that case, I should have expected you to
be able to pull off something like this.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I've heard all about you. Yes, I sure have.
You've had a rough time, [player_name].
I feel bad making you help us...

But hey, things are looking up! Our new
helper's just arrived.


Maybe you can give him some advice the
next time you come by. 
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You must be tired. Exhausted. Sleepy.
You should try to get to bed earlier.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ouch! Only one letter...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh! You're getting a pretty good wage here,
so you need to get at least twenty letters.
That's just how it's got to be.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The more letters you sort, the higher your
salary gets. Come back and try again!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[var. # letters sorted] letters.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Well, your salary was one Rupee per letter,
so you get [var. # rupees reward for sorting]!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name]! Be a pal and give our new
helper some pointers the next time you're
around! Just a few! Even one!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hey, man! I'm the new part-timer!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Green clothes...and a green hat?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Pardon me for asking, but you're
[player_name], aren't you?
Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ah-hah! I knew it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You're a legend among the part-timers here!



I really admire you, man!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Just once, I'd love to see the legendary
twenty-five letter sort! 
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Do your best, man!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh...my...gosh!
[var. # letters sorted] letters!
Amazing, man!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I'm so impressed! Seriously, man!



I've gotta tell my mom back home all about
this. I just gotta!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I've got a favor to ask of you, man.



I'm still new here, so I'm not allowed to
leave. So, would you mind putting this
letter to my mom in the postbox for me?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Thanks a lot, man!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I guess I could just throw it in here with
all the other letters, but...


I just can't bring myself to do it!
It's against the rules, man!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Zero...



Man...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
One letter...



Man, you must be really, really tired.
I hope you'll try again later, though.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[var. # letters sorted] letters.



Man, you must be bushed. Can't wait to see
you try again, though!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Huh? Oh, really...?
My mistake, man.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
C'mon... You really ARE
[player_name], aren't you?
Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Really? Truly, man?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Just go ahead and put that in the
postbox, man. Thanks.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hey, there! Long time no see, man!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What's up, man?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What's up, man?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Look, man, I have a big favor to ask of you.
You have just GOT to show me the
legendary twenty-five-letter sort! Pleeease!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So, what do you say, man?
Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Seriously?!?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I just really wanted to see it, man...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ummm... Have you had a chance to mail
that letter to my mom?


I'm counting on you, man!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You got something from my mom?



After I told her not to bug you and
everything! Sheesh!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
My co-workers let me in on your little
secret, man...


All letters addressed to you are specially
delivered to the postbox closest to you!
No matter what island you happen to be on!
That's so cool, man!

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I've heard all about the work you did here.



You've really been through some rough
times, man. Way to go.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
To my son's superior,



 Thank you very much for looking after my
 boy. This isn't much, but I hope you'll
 accept it all the same.

 I politely request your continued kindness
 toward my son.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Listen, man, you're not one of the native
islanders, are you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
My problem is, I just have no idea how I'm
supposed to get up there, and I have a job
interview...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I've got a bad feeling about this, man.



How am I supposed to get up there?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Look, don't be mad at us! It's not our fault
that we absolutely gotta have bombs to
get the treasure we're after!

How about you just think of it as payback
for the nasty little monopoly you've been
running here, yeah?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So I bet you're thinking it was foolhardy to
ask pirates to pay such an outrageous
price, huh? Yup. I bet you are.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...You know, Gonzo, I still can't get over
that bit of fast-talking you pulled to get
that information out of the postman!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Huh? ...Oh! Oh, yeah! That was smooth!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I tell you, the minute I set my eyes on that
[player_name], I just knew he was hiding
something back at Outset, yeah?

So when I saw that postman, I just
pretended like I was all worried about
the kid and stuff...

And presto! He spills the beans!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Good work, Gonzo! Really! Just top notch!
It's funny, though... I'm thinking this is
maybe the first time you've shown such
wit... Such cunning...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...You know, with your cunning and Miss
Tetra's smarts... If you two got married and
had a kid...

...That kid would be the greatest pirate to
ever sail the seas! Yup! The greatest!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You idiot!
Keep your mouth shut, yeah?
Don't be so stupid!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Miss Tetra! Are you listening to this nitwit?
Can't you dock him some pay or something?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Quit goofing off, both of you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Keep your childish jokes to yourselves and
get those bombs back to the ship!


The second you're done loading them up,
we're setting sail for Outset Island!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Whaaat!? Miss! We have to leave
immediately? But it's been so long since
we were on shore!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
We need to fill our bellies with some good
eating, yeah? How about we grub tonight
and shove off tomorrow morning instead?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I mean... Uh, I-I'm fine either way, of course!
Whatever you say is fine, Miss, is what I
mean to say!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...It's just that, the boys were so excited
to come to town, yeah? And I can't help but
think it would be awful hard on them to
leave so soon without a proper layover.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So, what say we set sail tomorrow, yeah?
What do you say, Miss?
That treasure isn't going anywhere!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You're with me, right, boys?!
Who's for a night of fun?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
.........
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You're all fools, do you know that?
You saw that demolished island!
You saw the senseless destruction.

We have to hurry on to Outset, or the
same thing could happen there!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Huh?



Not to be disrespectful, but by the sound of
things, you're worried more about that
island than the treasure, Miss...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Don't be ridiculous!
I want, you know...
the treasure...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
All right! Fine! Have it your way! We can
leave town tomorrow, you big babies.


But we're setting sail at first light, so no
sleeping in! Understood?

today's password, again?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Mako! Are you serious? You forgot already?
You're so useless.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Today's password is [var. Password], yeah?
Remember?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You know that Niko won't let you in if you
don't say it exactly right!
And he's real picky about it...
So I'll say it once more...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Today's password is
[var. Password], yeah?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[var. Password], eh?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Right, right! You may enter!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
No! No! That's completely wrong!
Now scram, non-pirate!

How do you treat a shark?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I can sail upon the water
or be filled with it. I am a...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh! [player_name]!
My old swabbie, [player_name]!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So you're alive?



All the other pirates said you got done
in by that bird-monster in the Forsaken
Fortress, so I thought...

Never mind what I thought! You're alive!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, I get it now! You came back because
you missed me so much!


I had no idea you wanted to be my swabbie
so badly! I see, I see...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Well, after you left, I went back to being
the bottom rung on the ladder...which is
why I'm stuck here while everyone else is in
town having fun and eating and stuff...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But...I guess being so worshiped by my
swabbie ought to cheer me up!


All right! Why don't we set you to your next
test, huh? This one is harder than the last!
Good luck! You'll need it, swabbie!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You can see there are lanterns hanging
throughout the room, right?


Well, last time when you pressed the
switch, platforms rose up for you to jump
onto, right? Yeah, well, this time, there
aren't any!
Which means you have to jump from one
rope to the next rope! Pretty tough...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
And that's not all! This time, I've put a
gate on this door, too!


The switch opens the gate, but it'll close if
you don't get here before time runs out.
Run out of time, and you'll have to try it
again, little swabbie!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The switch that opens the gate is in the
same place as before, so go step on it.


If you get all the way to this side before
time runs out, I'll give you the bombs we
got in town! Yeah, you heard me!

Give it your best shot, swabbie!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What?! You've gotta be...
You did it already?!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You're... You're incredible!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
This isn't good... I've never even passed this test...
How could he do it so quickly...?
And make it look so easy?!?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
And if I give this to him, everyone will
know for sure... Oh, I'll be so busted...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Uh...OK!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You're the best swabbie of all time!
So...I guess I'll just give you the bombs!
Go on! Take 'em!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Just don't tell anyone, OK? I'm serious!
Really serious! OK? OK!?!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
That's mighty courageous of you...trying to
steal treasure from pirates.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I suppose I should be shocked...but I'm more
amazed that you managed to survive after
being tossed out of that tower...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
From the look on your face, I have to guess
you haven't saved your sister yet, huh?


You don't give things much thought, do
you? You just rush in, never thinking how
badly things could go for you.

Like just now... The only reason you got
what you did was because we left a
simple-minded little rat like Niko behind to
look after things.
No one else would have parted with our
treasure so easily, I assure you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
And just how do you intend to use those
bombs, anyway?


Don't tell me you're going after Jabun's
treasure, too...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Right now, Jabun is hiding in a cave at the
back of the island you were born on.


But the entrance is blocked by a giant
stone doorway. You can't get in without
breaking down the door.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
We're going to relax in town and eat our
fill of whatever this town has to offer,
but we'll be leaving for Outset first thing in
the morning.
If you manage to find Jabun tonight, then I
guess you win.


But if you take too long, we'll come sailing
right by you tomorrow morning! And believe
me, you didn't get ALL of our bombs.

You'd better be quick, kid!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Wow! Awesome! You have a stone just like
the one that Miss Tetra has!


Hey, how do you use that thing? Can you
talk to Miss Tetra through that?!
Man! You're so lucky!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If you give me that stone, I'll be your
swabbie! I swear I will!


Come on, please! Please give me that stone!
Please! I'm begging here!

Eww, no!

Ooh, hoo hoo! My sweet, sweet daughter!
My only daughter! Poor Maggie... She was
captured by a bunch of villains and taken
to the Forsaken Fortress!
What on earth could those scoundrels want
with her? Are they just roaming around
looking for young maidens? Are they just
evil creatures who delight in mischief?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Please! Please save my poor daughter!
I beg of you! Here I stand, begging!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Young boy! Oh, brave young boy who
promised to rescue my daughter, Maggie...
Hurry! You must hurry! You can't dawdle!

I'm so very worried about my daughter.
I can't even sleep at night...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...That's terrible! Why, that's just...AWFUL!
TERRIBLE! You...mean child!


What harm could it possibly do you to
simply listen to the request of a poor and
miserable man like myself...?
What harm, I ask you?!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Eh?! Then...fine! Begone with you, you
wretch! I will find another to ask!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Please! Whatever you can do! Anything!
I beg of you! I PLEAD of you! Please!
I'm counting on you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Go away! Ptheh! Ptheh!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Well, crud!
Having a kidnapped daughter doesn't get
you a single Rupee, you know...!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I hope you'll give those scoundrels in the
Forsaken Fortress a good scare! They'll
pay for what they've done! Oh, yes! Pay!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Don't touch me with those filthy hands,
you mischievous little scamp!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Eh-HEM! This cabana belongs to the
master, and the master alone!


You grimy, trespassing little scoundrel!
Away with you! AWAY, I say!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...And just what do you want me to do
with that bit of rubbish!?
You disrespectful, unwashed imp!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ewww! Unclean! Most foul!
Don't lay those grungy hands...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Wait... Tha...?
Tha... That's_!?!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Why that's the...
Are you... Are you the new master?!
...Are you Master [player_name]?

Ah...
I am so pleased to hear that name!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hmmm...
I wonder...
I wonder if a boy like you will do...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...It's difficult to tell. Yes. Difficult.
You see, my one and only daughter, Mila,
was taken away from me to a frightening
place called the Forsaken Fortress...
I have asked many to rescue her, but it
seems to be a difficult voyage to that
cursed place...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I sincerely wonder about the wisdom of
asking a boy like you to do this...


But would you lend a hand to help rescue
my precious daughter?
Sure
No way
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You are a brave boy to take on this task.
I assure you, if you do rescue her, I will
pay you...as much money as it takes.
I'd give my entire fortune for her safety!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ugghhh... My life cannot get worse.



And my back has been aching fiercely of
late... If only I were ten years younger.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
By the way, it might interest you to know
that I've been renting out the first floor of
my home as a so-called auction house.

Of course, the auctions are held in the
evenings, after dark. Ho ho ho!
Do I sense more than a little interest?
Do you wish to join in as well?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Well? What do you think of the chances for
my daughter's rescue? They say the place
is called the Forsaken Fortress. Go now!
My daughter, Mila, waits for a hero!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hmm? What is it? ...You look like you want
something. Don't tell me...you need some
funds to get you started?!
Yes, I do
I suppose not
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Is that so? Speak up! I don't need any
timid heroes, boy!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You do want money? Oh, is that a fact?
Money, huh?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
In that case...I must first test
your resolve!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Wait just one moment!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

That comes to a total of...

I shall accept your payment!

Don't stand around looking like you've
been swindled...


Be on your way!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...What's this nonsense?!
Why, this is ridiculous!
You don't have enough money!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Be on your way!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You got a Yellow Rupee!
That's 10 Rupees.
What?! Th-That's it?!
This is a joke, right?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...When you break someone else's vases,
it's only natural that you compensate them
for the loss! You, my boy, are in the wrong
because of your destructive tomfoolery!
And now, because of you, I'm going to be
even richer...and I was quite rich before!
The world is a cruel place, isn't it?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, to see my sweet Mila again...
My precious little daughter...
I worry so over her welfare. I can't recall
the last time I slept more than a wink!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hrrrgh! Of all the cheekiness!
I can't BELIEVE you'd go around breaking
people's vases when you so clearly lack the
money to pay for them! Such rudeness!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Do you think you can just break someone's
vases and leave without paying for them?
I must chortle at your naivete! Ho ho!

Those happen to be extremely high-class
bone-china vases that run a minimum of
10 Rupees each!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Most assuredly, I shall now accept
compensation for them!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
As you can see, I've placed red Rupees in
three of my vases downstairs. So...
Which vases are they in?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh! Hi! We meet again!
...What?! Of course! Honestly!
I'm working! How dare you suggest that!

I'm done with all that sneaking around in
the dark. In fact, I head off to a faraway
island to work in the evenings now, so I
won't be seeing you at night anymore!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
All right? Well, all right.
Now, you're keeping me from doing my job,
so could you please step aside?

I-I'm not a thief! I swear! I haven't

Please let me go! It was just an impulse!
That's all! Just a bad idea!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

...Why won't you say anything?
Does this mean you're mad at me?


Could you at least listen to the
circumstances in my life that led up to this
moment? Please, you owe me that much!
Sure
Quiet, you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...What?! Why, that's just cruel! You awful
boy! Sometimes there are odd circumstances
that make people do what they do!
How could you be so close-minded?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I...was once the richest little debutante
in this town. Did you know that?


But one day, a monstrous bird came and
took me away to a terrible place called
the Forsaken Fortress, where I was locked
up and held captive. Oh, it was awful!
My father spent every last Rupee in his
coffers in an attempt to get me rescued.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
That's right! Every last bit of our family
fortune, gone...


That was when my life of poverty began.



Now, every day, from morning until night,
I'm busy working for the open-air shop.
So, as you can see, at least I'm trying
to settle into my poor lifestyle.
Doesn't that just tug at your heart strings?
What do you say about the tragic events
in my pitiable life?
That's terrible
That's kind of funny
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

And to make matters worse, for some reason
I still can't figure out, that slob Maggie,
who was the poorest girl in town, suddenly
got filthy rich! Maggie, of all people!
It makes me so mad that I want to do
something terrible! Grrrr!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Do you understand my plight?
Very well
Not at all
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

...Then you'll let me go?!
Unfortunately, no
I'll let you go
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

But...why not?!?
Because I'm honest
Because I like you
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

...Hah! You awful boy!
I was honest with you, too!
And now I'm just angry!

Good-bye!

I'm sorry! I guess it was a little too
complicated for a KID to understand!

...Oh. That's...really annoying!



You know? I just remembered! I have
something very important that I'm supposed
to be doing. I'll be RIGHT back, so can you
just wait here for me?
It'll only take a second!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

It's true... I know I'm quibbling over

It is a secret.[?] Yes. Quite a secret...[?]

No! Two! Two flying seagulls!


Wait! I see more seagulls! Three! Four! Five!
Now six! No! No! Seven seagulls! Eight!
This is madness! Eight seagulls...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Yes, yes, yes! First, let me thank all of you
bargain-loving people for joining us this
evening! Dear me, what a turnout!

The auction is about to begin. Yes!
And what do you suppose will pop up
as our item of the evening?!

Oh, dear me! I'm so excited I can't stop
sniffling! The calm before the auction storm
always makes my nose run!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Let's get to it! This evening, our glorious
auction item is...

This!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
A fabulous [var. auction item]!!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...Oh, my dear, what a prize! At last, the
suspense is over. But all drama aside, you
should know it is extremely rare to even get
a chance to own a fabulous item like this!
It is precious! Quite dear! Very valuable!
Yes, yes, yes! Listen well, for I do not lie!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
My dear! Oh my dear me! As you no-doubt
see, this is the item that [var. winner last auction]
won in our last auction...

...And yet, for reasons I cannot fathom,
[var. winner last auction] has since parted with this
fine item, and thus it is once again
appearing in our auction!
But do not worry! This certainly does not
mean the item is subpar. It just means that
clearly this item is worth far more than the
original amount it was purchased for!
But just listen to me delay! Enough with
the long-winded explanation...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Let the auction begin!

Our top bid is [var. winner last auction]'s, a bold and
spine-tingling offering of [var. winning bid]!
But dear me! Isn't there a lady or gentleman
here willing to bid more than [var. winning bid]?
Loosen up those purse strings, good people!
Cast caution to the wind and bid away!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[var. winning bid]! Very nice! But are you all going
to let [var. winner last auction] run away with the
prize for a mere [var. winning bid]!??! Truly?!

Dear me, can this be it? Are there any more
bids? Speak up, people! Going once!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

My dear! How incredible that such a
youngster walked away with the prize!
I've never seen such a fat wallet! That kid
was a bidding machine right up to the end!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...But now then! On to business.



For you lucky ones out there, and yes, yes,
also for you not so lucky ones... Let me say
thank you for your participation!
I must bring tonight's auction to an end.
Dear me, such excitement...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Dear people! Thank you VERY MUCH!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Whah! Wh-Why... I don't think I've ever
seen a wallet so tiny!


There's so little room in it that you must be
throwing away most of those beautiful,
sparkly Rupees that you find! How tragic!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

I can't believe she's a schoolteacher!

Rumor has it she has mountains of tacky

nothing in the world more than jewelry!

Hm? ...Now, just WHAT are you doing?
Were you listening to us, you scamp?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hmmmmm! It looks like you are carrying
a slightly larger wallet around with you,
but still...it is not quite large enough!

If you don't have a really, really big wallet,
it will be very difficult for you to carry
enough Rupees to your hardworking friend
Tingle! And that would be terrible!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Do you wish to bid?
Yes!

Yes, yes, yes! Come one! Come all!
Everyone is welcome to participate!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
And, of course, [player_name] will receive 
[var. winning bid] Rupees and an extravagant gift
for going to the trouble of providing such
a worthy and excellent auction item! Yes!
Now then, [player_name]...
Raise your hand high!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name]...
You sure got something nice there,
didn't you? I must admit, I'm filled with
envy! Maybe this time...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You can raise the bid higher than
[var. winning bid]! If you don't, you won't win!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yes, yes, yes, [player_name]! Fine!
Time to go! Run along now!


Thank you, thank you, thank you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, dear me! [player_name] bids [var. winning bid]!
And the crowd of auction-goers reels!
I see nothing but stunned faces!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ohhhhhhh! Oh, dearest me! Incredible!
The drama! Everyone is struck speechless
at [player_name]'s bid!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ohhhhhhh! Dear me! The spectacle of it all!
[player_name]! What an incredible bid!
You've sent shockwaves through the auction
house! Can these dear people recover?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Incredible! Such passion! Such bidding!
[player_name] steps up with a tremendous
bid! He's frozen everyone! Never have I seen
such a powerful display of bidding power!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ohhhhhhhh! This is incredible!
I never thought it possible, but the bid has
reached the ceiling for this item!
No higher bids can be accepted! Dear me!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Maybe you should kindly ask the fairy on
the island where you were born for a little
assistance! Yes, asking fairies for help
is always a good idea, sir!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Nooooo! Whyyyyy??? How??
It's not fair!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yessss! I won! I won! I'm the winner!
I'm the one who won! I'm number one!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Grrrrrrgh! 
...Next time, I'm definitely winning!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Well, honestly! Where on that tiny body
could he be hiding all that cash?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, I've never been happier! [?][?][?]
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
That...is so annoying!
...Next time, the prize is mine!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Where would a kid get that much money...?
That's crazy! I can't even match funds with
a child!? Talk about humiliating...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
This is the best feeling I've ever had in
my entire life!!! I am the all-time greatest
auction-bidding-guy in the whole world!!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
That is just not fair...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Just look at how young this kid is! The way
he handles his money is so...reckless!
Young sir, you are my hero tonight!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hooo... I can't believe it! At long last,
spring has arrived in my wintry world!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Grrrrrrgh! I can't stand it! I was right in
the thick of it! I was in the mix! Everything
was going according to plan! Yaaargh!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Kid... Well done, I guess.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You won't catch me losing to some kid!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Whuh?! This is terrible! Ahem! AAAA-HEM!
...Clearly there's been some kind of awful
mistake here! I demand an investigation!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The key to winning the auction is to be
right in the thick of all the bidding.
Be aggressive! It's the only way!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
For example, try upping the bid by more
than just a few Rupees. You need pretty
deep pockets, of course, but...

If you play it right, your move may just be
such a mental shock to the other bidders
that they don't know what to do!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If you manage to shock them, they won't
be able to bid until they snap out of it.
Then you can get things for cheaper than
they would normally go! Neat trick, huh?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What? You already knew all that? Well.
...I guess I underestimated you. Sorry.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So, I guess the objective would be to raise
it by 10%...or maybe even 20%?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
(...Sheesh! THIS guy?!)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
(What's THIS craziness?!?)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
(This is nuts! That wallet is bottomless!)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
(...EXCUSE me?)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
(No! ...I can't lose! I just can't!)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
(What's with this kid? And just how much
 of an allowance does he get, I wonder?)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
(Hmph! Not bad for a kid!)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
(...Urghhh!)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
(Gah! How did I get stuck competing with
this annoying little rich boy?! Drat it!)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
(...WHAT did he say?!)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
(Cripes! I'll get him for this!)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
(But he's just an innocent little boy...
 How did I let him trick me like that?!)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
(...Uh-oh! This kid means business!)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
(What?! ...Now?!)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
(Ack!!! Is he serious?! What a brat!)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
(My word!)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
(Oh, no! Another bid...)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
(Ahhhhhh... I can't believe this!
 The kid's rolling in dough!)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hey. Welcome.

I can't tell you how fun it's been for me.
And, uh, don't forget your umbrella or

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hello, hello, and hello! You are standing
in the one and only Chu Jelly Juice Shop!


You must have heard! Our potions are the
best! I'm telling you! They're TOO good,
in fact! ...They're absolutely incredible!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hrm...? What's that? What's Chu Jelly,
you ask, looking somewhat bewildered?


Oh, sir! You simply must be joking!
You don't know what Chu Jelly is?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Well, just ask yourself this, good sir!
What is a robustly nourishing element?
What is a mystical substance that is good
for the body and mind? Ask yourself!!
The words Chu Jelly roar out in answer to
these questions, proclaiming themselves to
be true! ...Why, it is the key ingredient
in the most effective potions around!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
All you have to do is bring an empty bottle
to my little juice shop here, and I'll let you
have a taste. Which begs the question...sir,
do YOU have an empty bottle?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Maybe you should kindly ask the fairy on
the island north of here for assistance!
Yes, when you ask a fairy for help, good
things are bound to happen, sir!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Have a look! Use [+][>] to see my wares.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Our restorative juices are specially made
with plentiful portions of Chu Jelly!


If you get your hands on any Chu Jelly,
please! I beg of you! Bring it to my shop!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...Hrm? What might that be?!
Why, sir, that's no potion ingredient!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Gasp! Is that...? Could it possibly be?!?
Did you, by chance, bring me Chu Jelly?!?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It's quite clever of you to be bringing such
quality ingredients to me! I'll take five of
them, if you can spare them!

And to thank you, I'll give you one free
serving! Not a bad deal, no sir.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...At least, I WOULD if you had an empty
bottle, but unfortunately, you don't!
...Too bad for you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
For every five glops of Chu Jelly you
bring me, I'll give you one free potion.
Come back after you collect more of that
wonderful, gooey, potion-making stuff!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But now that I look at your supplies, I can't
help but notice that you only have a little
bit of jelly, hrm? Not much at all, really.
Barely enough to mention, I might say.
That doesn't surprise me. Of course, not
many things do. For I am a genius.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hrrrmmmmmm... Oh hohhhhhhh... Ahhhhhh...
This is an extremely rare color of Chu Jelly!
...Perhaps it indicates a new breed!?
What a fascinating jelly development!
I've never seen one of this particular hue
on Pawprint Isle, a small atoll famous for
its robust Chu population...

But I digress, and the game is afoot! For
when it comes to making potions, I am a
true artist! I have been shown something
rare! Inspiration bubbles up from within me!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh... Wait for it... Here it comes... OHH!?
...That's it!

That's it! That's it! That's it! That's it!
That's it! That's it! That's it!
That's the sparkle I was looking for!
That sudden burst of inspiration! Eureka!
I'm going to use this Chu Jelly to create a
brand-new, unheard-of kind of potion!


It's been ten years since I began my now
legendary studies of the Chu Jelly. I must
begin mixing this new potion before my first
new inspiration in years vanishes!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...It... It's ready at last.
My new...Chu Jelly concoction.


It's still piping hot! And I want you to have
this first batch, my fellow jelly connoisseur!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...Hrm? What's this?



Nooooooooooooo! Oh, what a travesty!
You don't have an empty bottle!
I can't give you any potion!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
La di do!
My next project is to create a gripping
advertisement for my new potion!
You come back any time!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hrm... Hm... Hrrrrm???
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...Whoa whoa WHOA!
For a second there I thought we were all
square, but now it seems quite clear that
you don't have enough.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I hate to ask you this, but can you bring
me some more? Sorry, but we geniuses are
a fickle bunch, and when we say we need
more, we need more!

Hrm?! What!? Don't tell me you don't have
an empty bottle! I can't sell you any potion
if you don't have something to carry it in!
It's not my law...it's the law of physics!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...Your bottle is full! Sir, I can't sell you
any potion if you don't have an empty
bottle to keep it in. Sorry, but two potions
can't occupy the same space at one time!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...Sir! You don't have enough Rupees.
I'm sorry, but I don't just give potions
away. That's just bad business.

Zounds!! Whuh-what?!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You there! Halt!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...Oh, you're just some wretched street
urchin. I thought you were the postman.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Be thankful, because if you WERE the
postman, I would have shooed you out of
here before you could say "boo"!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But say... You look rather familiar for
a street urchin. Have we perhaps met
before someplace?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...What? Whatever do you mean? You
don't mean MY daughter, do you? Because
MY daughter has already been rescued
from the Forsaken Fortress. 
Why, she even returned with a huge load
of lovely, glittering, delicious treasure.
Thanks to her little incident, we've become
filthy rich overnight! And I mean FILTHY!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Why, there isn't a girl in the world
who's as good a child as my Maggie!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You may not have been able to help me...
but there's no harm done. I'm sure you'll
accomplish something in life...someday.

In the meanwhile, my daughter has
blossomed into quite the little beauty.
Run along! Go spend some time with her!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Eeeyeh heh heh heh heh!!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I'm telling you for the last time, we don't
allow postmen here!


...Oh! I'm sorry! My mistake!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Money for this! Money for that! A little
money over here! A little money over there!
Money, money, money...

Grah ha ha ha ha ha HAR!
Money makes the world go round!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What do you need, little urchin?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Eh?!
This is one of those Skull Necklaces that
my daughter, Maggie, brought back from
the Forsaken Fortress!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
These sell quite well at antique shops...
In fact, it was thanks to these beauties that
I became so filthy rich overnight...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Eh? And from the looks of it, I'd say you
have about twenty of these, don't you?
They aren't easy to come by, either.
Frankly, I'm amazed you found so many!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Twenty of them... If you bring me twenty
of them I'll give you quite a gift!
...I don't suppose an urchin like yourself
could scrape up a few more for me...?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Eeyeh heh heh heh heh heh!
I'll be bathing in money yet again!
The money bath! The only bath that gets
you filthy...filthy RICH!!!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
All right, boy... I'll give you this as a tip!
Now, I'm not thanking you or anything.
I'm just feeling good today!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I was once quite poor myself, you know.
Back then, I used to dream of owning a
boat... A boat I could use to go off in
search of treasure...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
And now look at my filthy richness!
Chase your dreams, little urchin!
Eeeyeh heh heh heh heh!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh! A Skull Necklace! And not just one!
You brought me twenty of them?!


You're a resourceful little urchin, huh?
Well, thank you so much! Allow me to take
them off your grubby little hands!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh! Did you bring me more? It looks like
they're a bit worn... That's a good sign. It
shows personality! Antique shops love that.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Don't worry, my little gutter urchin. I'll take
them all off your hands. I'd hate for you to
have come all this way for nothing!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Here's your tip: 20 Rupees!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Here's your tip: 40 Rupees!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Here's your tip: 60 Rupees!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Eeeyeh heh heh heh heh!
Keep picking them up, little urchin!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hmm? Are you actually bragging about
whatever that is?


Well, I suppose being poor does impair
one's judgement...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You're pretty bright for a grubby urchin!
Not many people your age can see the
value in these Skull Necklaces!

...But you know what? If this is all you've
got, it's not quite enough for me. Sorry!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, that Moe...
I just adore Moe's messy handwriting.
Ooh di loo la la! [?]

It's so dashing...and wild...and dangerous!
But enough of writing! Tomorrow I travel!
Troo di loo la la! [?]

...To where Moe waits for me...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Whenever I think of my dear father,
I lose my resolve to leave home...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
He's so infatuated with money and precious
objects. And I am quite precious, you know.
I guess I just have to stay here with him!
...By the way...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Lately he's been so obsessed with a
particular kind of strange necklace...
Yes, he fancies those Skull Necklaces!

That day I used [Y], [Z], and [X] to show him
all of mine, he just...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, Moe... My dear, sweet, burly Moe...
When, oh when, will you respond to me?
Troo di loo la la!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
My father has been so strict with me lately.
He won't let me out of the house!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
That's why I need you to take this
letter_this note to Moe_and drop it into
the postbox for me. Please, troo di loo la!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ohhh... To think that I would survive my
ordeal and return to this town...


And to think that I would ever be able to
live in such a beautiful, opulent house...
It's like a dream come true!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hmmmm... But no! NO! It's a nightmare!
Without HIM by my side, it's like a
rainstorm rages in my heart...

He was so kind to me in the Forsaken
Fortress. That sweet boy who gave me all
those expensive necklaces when I fled from
that cursed island...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Just hearing his name lifts my spirits...
Moe... The wonderful Moblin from the
Forsaken Fortress!

...Oh, Moe! Why, Moe?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I'm always writing heartfelt letters filled
with my overflowing emotions, but why
don't you answer me, Moe?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...Agh!



This is bad! Oh, terribly bad!
I've already drifted off into my own
dream world! 
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...Oh, by the way, I have a request for you.
Could you take the letter I've just finished
inking and deliver it to the postbox for me?
Please? I beg of you!
Sure
No way
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Eeeeee!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What?
Really?
You're such a dear!
...You've made Maggie so happy!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The postbox! Don't you dare forget!
...But you must promise not to read it!
The secrets of a girl's heart are to be
shared only when she so desires!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Love is so very painful...



When I think of my precious little Moe...
Troo di loo la la! I can't sleep at night...
Why doesn't he write me back?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Is... Is that...?! Could it be?
The letter from Moe that I saw in
my dreams?!

...Let me read it this instant!!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Umm...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
"This is Moe."
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
"I... like... you...
 ...Ma...ggie...


 ...so...much...that...
 ...I...want...to...
 ...eat you...for dinner."
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
......
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Did you hear that? Those words?
This means... I mean, it must mean...
Can it be...?!?

Is this his marriage proposal?



It must be! At last, my feelings have
been conveyed to Moe! At last he
understands how I feel!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
This is the happiest day of my life!
Troo di doo di loo la LAAAAAAAA!
From here on out, today will be the
anniversary of true love for me and Moe...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh! It completely slipped my mind!
I must thank you for your role in this!
To commemorate my anniversary of true
love...I give you this!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Troo di loo hoo!
Treasure it always!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What's the matter?
Hang it up proudly!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Why, this trinket is just like...
This is one of the necklaces that Moe gave
me so many of when I was stuck in the
Forsaken Fortress!
It was by selling these for lots of cash that
my father and I were finally able to escape
from poverty!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...Honestly! You just don't understand,
do you?! Open up your ears!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Silence! I'm telling you we don't allow
postmen here! Begone! Begone!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Don't be ridiculous!



I went through great trials and
tribulations to go all the way to the
Forsaken Fortress and return with
Moe's letter...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
SILENCE! Begone! Begone!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Then, please! Be reasonable! Can you at
least sign for the letter?!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
SILENCE! Begone! Begone!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Just acknowledge I was here!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
SILENCE! Begone! Begone!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
RAAAAAAWRK! Foolish man! Now you've
made me angry! I cannot even look you in
the face any longer, or I fear I might...

...I must go somewhere to cool my feathers!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...Well, what a wretched, unruly postman!
I don't know anything about any Mr. Moe
in any Forsaken Fortress! And yet he
always comes here bringing his letters!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Does this Moe think I'll let him lay a hand
on my one and only daughter, Maggie?!
I don't care whose letters they are, they'll
never reach her on my watch!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh! It's you! I'm sorry you had to witness
me fly off the handle like that at
Maggie's house. I'm most embarrassed.
That man just...never mind.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
To tell you the truth, though...



I came to deliver a letter addressed to
Maggie from a Moblin named Moe, but as
you saw, the girl's stubborn father won't
permit me to give it to her.
What a stubborn, meddling old man...
Refusing to accept letters from the
postman? Who's heard of such nonsense!?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I went to great trouble to go all the way to
the Forsaken Fortress, and it was a most
frightening ordeal, let me tell you!

...If I don't deliver this letter, then I am a failure of
the delivery trade...


But...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I have other deliveries waiting to be made.
I cannot mope here forever!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Actually, though...



I have an idea. That old fool may not
permit postmen on his premises...


But surely he would allow YOU in the place,
would he not? Could you deliver this letter
to Maggie in my stead?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What do you say?
I'll do it
Actually, I'm busy
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Honestly? You, young man, are a lifesaver.
...It truly never hurts to ask!
I shall leave this letter in your care!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I'm counting on you to put this in
Maggie's hands. And I thank you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Alas...
Is there no one to take my place?
The life of a postman is so hard...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ahhhh, that lessens the weight on my
shoulders by quite a bit! How nice!
Perhaps I'll do a little sight-seeing here
in town before I go!
...Although I do have other deliveries
waiting to be made...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ohhhhhh... No, that's not it_that's just
NOT it! And the problem is, even though
THAT'S not it, THIS isn't it, either...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Say, guy, you know what I was just
reminded of?


Long ago, I met this delightful little
guy who performed the most dazzling
magic dance... A dance that turned night
into day right before my very eyes!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I can remember those fabulous dance
moves, but I just CAN'T seem to get
that intricate rhythm down...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Do you think you know the rhythm, guy?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
That magical dance that changes day into
night and night into day...


If I could only recall the rhythm. Oh, the
RHYTHM! Then I could dance it perfectly!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Why! Why does my dancing do nothing to
the skies?! Why am I cursed so? Just where
am I lacking, guy? What is WRONG with
me? I must know!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Unh, unh, CHA!
Unh, unh, CHA!
That's...
That's it!
That's the rhythm I've been trying to recall!
OH! I can feel it! I can FEEL it, guy!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
AUGGGHHH!!!
No! No! No! That's ALL wrong, guy!
Watch me! Watch me DANCE!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
That's it! That's IT, and it's PERFECT!
I'M PERFECT! Now bring on the night!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
That's it! That's IT, and it's PERFECT!
I'M PERFECT! Now let the sun SHINE ON!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...Hey!!!
What's the matter?
Nothing happened... Nothing AT ALL!
WHYYYYY???
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh! Are you giving up already, guy?
...But you haven't done enough!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, dear! Pardon me. Pardon ME, guy!
I was so fully and wholly absorbed in my
dancing that I didn't even notice little old
you standing there!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

lookin' so sad? You think it's fun to go
walkin' through town lookin' all pathetic?
You think that makes you a big man?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You look like a goody-two-shoes! And we
hate goody-two-shoes! You can't go walkin'
around our town pretendin' to be all big!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
This town is our turf_the turf of the world-
famous Killer Bees! Don't mess with us!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yeahhhhhhhh! Buzz! Buzz!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What're you lookin' at, bud?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...Huh huh huh! Hey, bud, what are you?
Some kinda country rube? I mean, look at
that outfit! What a get-up!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...Are you all alone or what?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You must feel pretty lonely walkin' around
a place like this all by yourself. What
are you doin', anyway?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You stink, mister!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
We ain't seen your face around here
before, bud!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yeahhhhhhhh!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yo, bud! You got a problem with us
Killer Bees? Huh? DO YA?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Don't tell me it's that annoyin' hag of a
teacher again... Is it?


You came here to give us a talkin'-to
'cause Mrs. Marie asked you to, right?


Tell us not to skip school, right, bud?
Tell us not to be "tardy", right, bud?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Well, forget about all that!
We're the mighty and invincible gang of
four_the Killer Bees! Do you think we'd
listen to a chump like you?!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But...I'll tell you what, bud! If you wanna
challenge us to a competition, then we'll
think about maybe listenin' a little bit!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What do you say, bud? Do you want to
challenge us?
I'll take you on!
Leave me alone
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You wimpy iiiiiiiiiidiot!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
OK! Your funeral, bud! The rules are simple!



We're gonna go hide somewhere, and if
you find us, we're gonna run! You gotta
try to catch us. Easy as that, bud!

We won't hide indoors or nothin', and we
won't leave this island, so look for us
around in the shadows and behind
buildings and stuff.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If you catch all four of us, we lose.
You got it, bud?
Ready...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Goooooo!!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh!
I can't believe it. You found all four of us...
and you caught us all, too!
Talk about utter defeat!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Looks like we lost our touch, Killer Bees.



I guess maybe it's time we chilled out.
From now on, we won't cause no more
trouble for anyone...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
And to reward your hide-and-seekin' skills...
Here! Take this, bud!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Uh, this is our favorite possession, but
you've proven that you're worthy.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
To our bud_the hide-and-seek master!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, and one more thing... We need you to
apologize to Mrs. Marie for us. All right?
We're countin' on you, bud!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yo, bud! Are you lookin' for a Picto Box
or somethin'?


Yeahhhhhhhhhhh! Thought so!
There ain't nothin' in this town that we
Killer Bees don't know!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Boss! I heard about this from my dad!



A while back, this thief stole a Picto Box,
and he was held in the town jail for a
long, long time! Yeah, real long!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
That thief managed to get free after a
while, but the box he stole never got found.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Huh huh huh!
Maybe it's still hidden somewhere in the
jail cell! Don't you think? Maybe?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Gimme a break!
...How stupid would that be!
Real stupid, that's how stupid.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Welcome to Mrs. Marie's School of Joy!



I don't think I've ever seen your face around
here before, my young scholar...
Are you a new pupil?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What can I do for you on this fine day?
We need to talk
Nothing
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, you're the fine young gentleman who
gave me a Joy Pendant present! How could I
forget? How many did you give me again?
[?]? My, but wasn't that nice!
So! What can I do for you, young man?
Talk to me
Nothing
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I see...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I know I may look a bit flashy for a
teacher, but I assure you I am one. How
long has it been since I opened my school
here on Windfall Island? Twenty years?
Ever since then, I've been teaching the
children of this island about true joy!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But I do have a rather joyless problem...
There's this delinquent gang of four young
boys who never listen to a word I say.

Even though I wait patiently for those boys
to show up, they never come. It's as if they
don't want joy in their hearts!

Could you please catch their leader, that
little boy named Ivan, and talk some sense
into him for me?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Please, young man? For me?
Yes, ma'am
Sorry, lady
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...Oh! That does NOT make me joyful!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, thank you so much! You're such a dear.
They're such troublesome little boys. I'm at
my wit's end over how to handle them...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But they won't be so mean to a boy their
own age, will they? I should think not.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Good luck, young man!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Those four little troublemakers are out
running around in the plaza again today.
I'm counting on you to talk to them!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You did it, didn't you...?
You said something to those delinquents
for me, didn't you, dear?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You can't fool me! I watched it all from the
shadow of my door! You really are a dear!
You fill me with joy! I have to reward you...
so here's a little spare change!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
When it comes to children, my eyes never
deceive me. Someday, dear, you will grow
up to be a fine young man, and your name
will go down in history...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
That's what I think, dear!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...What terrible weather we have today.
Little boys shouldn't be out wandering
around at a time like this! My, no!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Well! What would you like to talk about?
Pendants
Volunteering
The kids
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Although I may be a school teacher, I have
a certain...flair about me, don't you think?
And let me tell you, I love jewelry more
than anything else in the world!
Hoo hoo! And why not? It's not like I can't
afford it! Why, I have so much cash, I have
my very own oasis cabana! But...I happen to
be after a very particular kind of jewelry.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You see, lately I have been rather taken
with collecting Joy Pendants! Those are
very rare trinkets that you can't buy at any
store. They're quite amazing.
Why, their color...and their shape...
I feel as if I was destined to gather them!


If you have any, please show them to me.
Just set them to [Y], [Z], or [X]!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Tell me, dear, do you know about the
Joyous Volunteer Association and the work
they do?

The association's objective is to decorate
our little town of Windfall with flowers and
other small decorative items to make our
town a better, more joyous place.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If you must know, the society came into
being when the shop master Zunari arrived
here. He heard about my efforts to spread
joy, and it moved him deeply.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
He asked himself, "Is there nothing a poor,
worthless merchant such as myself might
do to make this a better place?" And then,
suddenly, his eyes were opened!
That's when I gave him a little advice:
"Do something that only YOU can do!"
...Yes, that's what I told him, dear!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It was after that that he began to show an
interest in volunteer activities...


He apparently came from a very cold place,
but let me tell you something: Despite his
appearance, that Zunari is definitely one
hot volunteer!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You've seen that rascally gang of four
walking around the plaza out there as
if they own the place, haven't you, dear?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Apparently, they came up with the most
suitable of names for their little gang...
or so I've heard.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
"We be tough!" "We be bad!" "We be the
toughest, baddest boys in town!"
"...Yeah! We're the Killer Bees!"
...It went something like that.
I guess they were looking for something
of a fierce name for themselves. They sort
of failed spectacularly, if you ask me.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It must be nice...to be young!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, dear! You needn't show off like that!
I get it! I get it! You're incredible, dear!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
My dear!
That's...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
A Joy Pendant!!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
To tell you the truth, I love jewelry above
all else! And that... Why, that is extremely
rare and hard to come by. It's the hottest
thing around, dear!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh my, yes! I will happily take a single one
from you! No, no! I insist! Only one.


To tell you the truth, I'd actually like about
20 of them. But that would probably only
happen in my wildest of dreams.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
How many Joy Pendants do you have right
now? [?]...?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...This'd be the Bomb Shop!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

My ancestors been making bombs for
generations. Uh-huh. Now, seems like I'm
the only person left in the world who still
works in the bomb industry...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...Which means I'm the best in the world!
And which means I don't go selling my work
without approving of who I sell it to!
And I don't approve of you! So beat it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I didn't call for you, boy! Go on, now!
Beat it!

Do you expect me to sell my fine bombs
to some boy who has no money?! HAH!
I'm done with you! Beat it! Scram!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Good sir, you just can't carry that much.
Please, now, only purchase what you can
take with you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Thank you so much!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Shoo! Beat it! Scram, vermin!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...Please, can't you use our door to enter?
Why else would we have one, now?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Well, now! Good evening!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hey, now! Here again?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yes, yes! I rent out the first floor of this
mansion in order to run a nightly auction.


And actually, tonight's auction is about to
begin. Oh, dear me, is it EVER!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Now it is, indeed, an auction, but I like
to describe it in more simple terms: it is a
competition of the very highest order!

Oh yes! It is a competition to see who can
get the item that is being auctioned! Can
you outbid everyone else? Do you have the
courage and the fundage? Oh, the drama!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ah! But what's this? Well, dear me!
...Do I detect a hint of curiosity?
I believe I do! Fortunately, we welcome
bidders of all ages! Both kids and adults!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yes, so tell me... Would you like to
participate in the auction?
Absolutely
Not tonight
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
No, no. It is my fault. I should not have
invited you. Do not mind me. Ignore me.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Really? Dear me...
Really?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Now, you are completely fine with me NOT
explaining the auction to you...
Am I correct in assuming this?
I'm fine with that
I'm completely NOT fine
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yes! Good... That speeds things up!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Then, my dear, allow me to explain.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Once the auction begins, you must shrewdly
tap [A] repeatedly so you can earn the right
to bid. Oh, the tapping! The excitement!

Yes, yes, when you want to bid, tap [A]!
As you do, your gauge will gradually build
up. Once your gauge is full, your chance to
bid has finally come! Oh, dear me, yes!
Now, when you bid, you're naming the price
you're willing to pay for the item.
Let us just call it your chance to show
off your wealth! Flaunt it, my dear!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Of course, if your fellow bidders try to
buy the item out from under you by raising
the bid, you can always raise it in return!
Indeed, this produces much excitement!
This dramatic back-and-forth goes on until
time runs out, at which point the person
who had the highest bid gets the sublime
honor of purchasing the item.
The auction only lasts one minute_not
counting the time people spend talking!
But do not worry! I will show you how much
time remains when you make your bid.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...Now do you understand?
I understand
I still don't get it...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...The blood doesn't flow through your brain
very well, does it? Dear me, what a shame.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Very well, then! Let us begin immediately!
It's no time to dawdle. The auction is afoot!
On your toes! On your toes!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Ahh, yes...
I'm so busy...
So wonderfully busy, indeed.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yes, yes, yes, my fine sir! You seem to be
in quite good spirits. And why not?


Thanks to you, my shop has become quite
fine! Quite fine, indeed! Dear me, yes!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
My dear! I am most incredibly grateful.
Most grateful, indeed!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yes, yes, yes! A shipment has indeed
arrived! A shipment of new products!


Thanks to you signing agreements with
merchants for me, my product line has
increased dramatically! Dear me, yes!

Please, please, please! Keep it up!
My, you're such a hard worker!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Say, I've heard that there is a wandering
merchant on Bomb Island, a small land
mass near the Forest Haven.

If there is such a fellow, perhaps you can
trade something with him. If you did, it
might convince him to send his products
to be sold in my shop.
The more you are able to trade, the
wider my product assortment becomes.
And wider is better! Oh, my dear, yes!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yes, yes, yes! You're the young master
who purchased my sail! At last, with those
funds, I have been able to open my stall!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But...I hate to say that my poor little stall
is not an instant success. In fact, it is
rather deserted, I'm afraid to say...

...I think this tragic turn of events is
due to the fact that I don't have a wide
enough lineup of products. For, if I am to
be fully honest, I only have one product.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
To put it another way, I think my stall
would do much better if only I could stock
rare items that people can't get here in
town... Yes, yes, that is what I need!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Then I would make plenty of money!
Not just plenty of money...it would be like
taking candy from many rich babies...
No, no, not even that!
By running a prosperous business, I can
play my part to help this town develop
and become a happy place... Yes, yes, that
is the proper perspective!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But dear me! If only I had a young partner
to help me out... A real go-getter...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...My young master, you sadden me.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yes, yes! Master! Now that I take a longer
look at you, I see that you have a fine
Delivery Bag, do you not? Dear me, it is
a bag fit for a hero...of delivery!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I have a small request, and it requires the
use of that bag...
A request?
I'm out of here!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, dear me! I knew it, young master!
I knew you would understand my plight...
It is a rather long-winded explanation, but
please take the time to hear me out.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
My stall is a kind of general store that
makes its money by obtaining rare products
at inexpensive prices and then selling them.
...With a reasonable mark-up, of course.
However, because I have so few products to
sell, the shop remains rather...deserted.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I will sell anything! I am a master of the
sale! I just need to get some new products!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Could you not seek out traveling merchants
and negotiate supply contracts with them
for me?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
No, no, no! Do not look so frightened! I say
contracts, but it is just a word. You do not
have to do anything very difficult.

All I need for you to do is trade one of my
products for a new product that the
merchant has in stock. You see, among
merchants, a trade is proof of a contract!
That is to say, it is the merchant's oath...
That is what we call it. Yes, yes.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Merchants that have sworn a merchant's
oath will afterwards send their products
to me. It is the way things work.

So, as you succeed in trading my products,
my product lineup will increase!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Do you understand everything I've told you?
Perfectly!
Not at all...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...My dear! The blood flows slowly through
your brain, doesn't it? How awful for you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yes, yes! Young master, you are now my
new salesman! No, no! Scratch that! Starting
today, you and I are partners! Dear me, yes!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I give to you my proof of contract...
In other words, this is my merchant's oath!
Take it with you, my young partner!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The first thing you need to do is take
this to another traveling merchant and
trade it for something...to build on
the foundation of my merchant's oath.
As soon as you trade, the merchant you
traded with will send his products to
my shop, thereby increasing my product
line. Which will make me quite happy!
Well...your new trading partners_the
traveling merchants_are waiting for you
somewhere out there on the Great Sea!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
My dear! My expectations are high!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
No, no, no! Young master! I have ill news!
Someone has been fiddling with my safe!


I come to the shop first thing in the morning
and DEAR ME! I see signs suggesting
someone fiddled with things!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Perhaps someone has been sneaking in here
at night and doing shady things!
...But I do not have any proof.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Dear me! Such a mystery! If only I could
catch them in the act, I could scold them!
And OH! What a scolding I would give!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yes, yes! Young master, look! Already, my
shop has a wide variety of products to
choose from! It is a cornucopia!

Thanks to you, young master, every morning
the postman comes with packages from the
traveling salesmen you traded with.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
At last, my humble stall has the
appearance of a full-fledged store!


My dear! Your unflagging dedication has
strengthened my determination to live my
life for the success of my business!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Master, you are the savior of my stall!
I must thank you from the very bottom of
my heart.

This is my most prized posession_next to
my hoodie coat, of course! It is none other
than the Zunari family treasure...
Please accept it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
This is the only heirloom I brought with
me when I moved here from my hometown.
...Well, excluding the lovely sail you
purchased from me earlier, of course!
It is a magical heirloom...one that calls up
a mysterious power to protect your body
from harm.

Of course, you can use it even when you are
sailing the open seas. My dear! Please!
Use this to protect yourself...as you seek
out more merchants! I beg of you!
And please, be on the constant lookout
for new and exciting products...
...Not that I have anything left to reward
you with if you find any...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yes, yes, yes! It is another fine day, is it
not? Days like this are best spent shopping!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Use [+][>] to have a look at my wares!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
No, no, no! If you wish to speak to me,
please, I must insist you do so at my
reception counter. Rules are rules!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Do not look at me...look at my products!
If you are shopping for chitchat, then
we can do that at the reception counter.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Come back soon!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
No, no, no! You do not have enough money!
This is a business, not a charity!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Dear me! Your bag seems to be quite full,
does it not? How tragic for you!


I would feel bad if I completely filled your
delivery bag with my goods, so I will only
let you put a maximum of three items from
my shop in it. Does this sound good?
You can come back for more after those
are gone.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

My dear fellow! I can't have you trying
to come in this way! No, no, no!


...Go over there!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
No, no, no! It looks like your bag is
quite full, is it not? Yes, it is!


I can only put a maximum of three of my
products in your bag. Come back after you
use all of them up!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hmm... And who might you be? Why do I
get this strange feeling that we've met
before?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ah... It's you...
The little boy who promises big promises
and then fails to deliver on them. Hmph.
Too bad you couldn't save my daughter.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Fortunately, not everyone in this world
fails to deliver. As it turns out, my dear
Mila was saved by a group of kind pirates.

The pirates had a leader... Tetra, I believe
she said her name was. I was most grateful.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
She did demand a rather hefty reward, though...



Thanks to them, my fortune has vanished!
...We've hit rock bottom!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But...my little Mila is alive and home safe
where she belongs, so I can't complain.
A daughter is more important than money.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Being poor must be pretty rough...
You take one look at me, and that's the
first thing you think, isn't it?

I ask you, why is that? Sure, the days can
get kind of tough, but good things still
happen, don't they? Money doesn't make
the sun shine, you know.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Just recently, my missing daughter, Mila,
was returned to me. I didn't think I
could ever feel more joyful...

But then she went and started working at
the shop to help out with our tight
family finances! What a trooper!

Could that girl be any more of an angel?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Although...I do worry about how she 
always seems to sneak out at night...


Is there any shop in this town that's
open at night?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hmmm... The look in your eyes seems to
imply that you have something to say.
Well? What is it? Are you suggesting that
I should go to work, too?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Owwww! But OH! My back has truly been
hurting me of late... Really, just ACHING...
If I were twenty years younger...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Lately, my daughter, Mila, has been
sneaking out at night to go somewhere.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I suppose I could tag along and secretly
follow her, but when I think about the
possibility of her doing something bad,
I just...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If_and this is a huge, unlikely "if"_if you
happen to find Mila about to do some
dishonorable act, will you stop her for me?

Just do it if you catch her in the act.
Not that she ever would, but if she does,
just jump out and stop her! Please!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Honestly, though, despite how my little
Mila may look, she is a kind child who
thinks only of her poor father.
She'd never do anything bad...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
My daughter and I have managed to eke
out a decent life, and in the process,
I've realized a great truth...

There is something more important than
money in the world...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I think at long last I've finally come to
understand just what true happiness
really is.

...And I'm thankful for it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hey? Have we met before somewhere?
Aren't you...? No... Couldn't be.


Me? I am but a poor, traveling merchant.
I travel the world searching for rare objects
of all sorts_modern and ancient, foreign
and exotic.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
My dream has always been to someday
open my own shop, but plans have a way
of getting delayed, and now it's been
thirty years since I started...
Time certainly laughs at us all, huh?
And still, day in and day out, rain or shine,
I spend my days looking for curiosities and
rare items.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Which reminds me, that Delivery Bag of
yours looks like it might have some
rare treasure in it...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If you happen to have something of the
quality that one could put on sale in
a shop, would you consider trading it?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I have many fine products to trade.
If you have something you'd like to trade,
could you show it to me, please?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I am but a poor traveling merchant.
I roam the sea collecting rare goods in the
hopes of someday opening my own shop.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If you have anything in that Delivery Bag of
yours that would be perfect for selling in a
shop, could you show it to me, please?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
How satisfactory.
How utterly satisfactory!
I am through working today!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Running a business is eight-tenths effort...
but one still shouldn't work too much.
...That's what my father taught me. And
that's why I trade only three items per day.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hooooo! I sure put in a lot of work today.
Satisfactory! Let's keep up that same level
of effort and dedication tomorrow!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Say, I heard there's another traveling
merchant not unlike myself on Great Fish
Island to the west of here.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
They say that for every person in the world,
there are two more who look exactly alike...
I wonder what my twins are like?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ummm... Thanks for coming all this way
to show me what you have, but I never
trade more than three items in one day.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Running a business is eight-tenths effort,
but overworking yourself isn't healthy.
That's what my father taught me.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Huh? Why, that's...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hmmm... You don't seem to have any items
one could easily sell at a shop, do you?


I really only want to trade for the kind of
rare items that one can carry around in a
Delivery Bag. Everything else is just a little
too unsatisfactory for my needs.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ummm... This isn't quite the type of
thing that sells itself very well. I'm sorry.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yours has some cracks in it, so I'll need
75 Rupees on top of the trade.
It's a deal
No way
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hmm... Gee... Uhh...
40 Rupees, maybe?
It's a deal
No way
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yours has a little blemish there, so I'll
need 65 Rupees in return.
It's a deal
No way

Yours has a little ding there, so I'll

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yeah...This guy is pretty valuable, so I have
to ask for about 100 Rupees for him.
It's a deal
No way
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear...
You don't have enough Rupees.
I'm afraid our contract talks have ended
in failure. How unsatisfactory.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Thank you so much!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Thanks! That settles things.



I'll give you your item, as promised. Hold
out both of your hands...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So, by trading your goods for my goods,
we have formed a merchant's oath.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So, from now on I shall honor our
merchant's oath by sending shipments of my
product to the Windfall Island Shop.

How, you ask? Why, my good friend the
postman will take it there for me, so it will
probably get there before you do. Just go
back to Windfall and check for yourself.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Thanks again!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I'm what you call a traveling merchant! Yes,
I'm just a cheery fellow who bobs between
waves in search of all manner of rare items:
cracked and pristine, wild and woolly!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I came from distant lands because I heard
there was a treasure of great worth on this
island, but I can't find a thing.

I thought perhaps my fate would cross with
that most mystic of rare items: the fabled
Shop Guru Statue! ...But it seems as though
I am off the mark yet again.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
By the by, for some reason, looking at that
Delivery Bag of yours gives me the sneaking
suspicion that it might have some rare
treasure hidden in its depths...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If you have anything even slightly out of
the ordinary in there, would you mind
trading it to me? Anything at all?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
This knapsack I'm lugging around is stuffed
full of all sorts of wondrous things! Why
don't you show me what you've got, and I'll
show you what I'll trade for it?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You see, there's this mystical curio that
I've been seeking for ages now...
It's called the Shop Guru Statue.

It's said to be a statue of the most
incredible of men, a man who has long
reigned at the peak of the business world.
...But why would you have it?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I've heard there are traveling merchants on
the Mother & Child Isles and on Bomb
Island... I wonder if either of those guys
might have it...
Awwwww... If someone would just trade
that most excellent item to me, I would
offer them a heart-filling reward in return.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yes, yes...
I'm closed for the day.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Running a business is four-fifths effort,
but overdoing it is a bad policy.
...My Pops gave me that advice long ago.
That's why I trade only three items per day!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Whoa! That was a worthy day of work!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ah, what kind of man is he, this so-called
Shop Guru?! I am so intrigued by him that I
lay awake at night just thinking about him.

If someone would just trade his idol to me,
I would give them a heart-filled reward in
return. Oh, would that happy event occur!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I hear there is a traveling merchant on the
Mother & Child Isles and another on Bomb
Island... I wonder if either of those guys
has that fabled Shop Guru Statue...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Err... Thanks for coming all this way
to show me this, but I trade only three
times per day. So sorry.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Business is four-fifths effort, but overdoing
it is no good for anyone.
That's what my Pops always said!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Huh? That's...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hmmm... You don't seem to have any items
one could easily sell at a shop, do you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ummm... This isn't quite the type of
thing that leaps off the shelf. So sorry.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

um, a Postman Statue...is it not?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Why, that's a Shop Guru Statue...is it not?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
In that case... Would you be interested in
trading that for this Sea Flower?
Sure
No thanks
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Most worthy! Then my fee will be...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...Are you sure? If you're kicking yourself
later for not trading, don't blame me!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Well, I suppose 20 Rupees will do.
It's a deal
No way
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ooh... I'll give you a huge deal on this:
25 Rupees will do just fine.
It's a deal
No way
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If I can just get 20 Rupees for this,
that'll cover me.
It's a deal
No way
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hmm... I need at least 100 Rupees for this
one, I'm afraid.
It's a deal
No way
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It looks like the item you're offering is
kind of dirty, so how about 65 Rupees?
It's a deal
No way
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Your item there is in need of repair, so
how about 75 Rupees?
It's a deal
No way
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Errr... I'll give you a huge deal:
only 25 Rupees!

The colors on that thing you're offering
have faded most terribly, so 60 Rupees!

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no...
You don't seem to have enough Rupees.
It looks like our contract talks have come
to a most unworthy conclusion.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Thank you, as always!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Thanks! That settles things.



I'll give you your item, as I promised.
Hold out both hands...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So, by trading your goods for my goods,
we've formed a merchant's oath.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

How, you ask?! Why, my good pal the

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Thanks again!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
My heart-filled reward has touched your
heart, hasn't it?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Is...
Is that...?
It couldn't be...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I'm what's called a traveling merchant.
Just a poor wanderer cruising the world
in search of rare objects of all sorts_
new and old, strange and unsettling.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I detected a scent wafting from this island
that suggested to me that there might be
something of value here, so I sailed my tiny
raft all this way from far, far away...
But the high rock wall on the main island
blocks my way, so it seems as though I
won't be able to get much farther. What a
disagreeable turn of events.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
However, my boy, that Delivery Bag of
yours smells to me as if it might well
be home to rare and unique items...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If you have any curios that might be worthy
of selling in a shop, might you trade them
to me?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Someday, I'm going to open myself a shop...
a huge shop! No! A MEGA-SUPER-STORE!
I'm trying to find goods to sell, so can
you show me what you've got on you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I'm what's called a traveling merchant.
I scour the world for oddities and rare
items in the hopes of one day opening my
own shop. 
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If you have anything in that Delivery Bag
of yours that's even the slightest bit
rare or of an interesting nature, could you
let me take a look at it?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
How agreeable. How truly agreeable!
That's as much work as I'm going to do
today! I'm calling it a day!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Running a business is eight-tenths effort,
but you don't want to work yourself into
a grave! I trade only three times a day!
...That's what my dad taught me to do.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ahhhhh! I sure put in a lot of work today.
Quite agreeable! Let's sustain that same
level of grit and determination tomorrow!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, hey... I hear traveling merchants have
appeared on Great Fish Isle and Bomb
Island, too...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If you want to know the truth, I was
amazed to hear there were other traveling
merchants in this day and age! What an
odd couple of fellows they must be!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Running a business is eight-tenths effort...
but one still shouldn't work too much.
...That's what my father taught me. And
that's why I trade only three items per day.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
A business is eight-tenths effort, but
working too much is bad for your health.
...That's what my dad taught me.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Huh?
Why, that's...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hmmm... You don't seem to have any items
one could easily sell at a shop, do you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ummm... This isn't quite the type of
thing that shoppers crave. I'm sorry.

Why, that's a Shop Guru Statue...right?

________________________________________
In that case... Would you be interested in

Sure
No thanks

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yeah... That'll be 20 Rupees on the dot.
It's a deal
No way
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yeah... A measly old 10 Rupees will do.
It's a deal
No way
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Well, that thing you've got doesn't look so

Oh, alas, alas, alas, alas, alas...

________________________________________
Thanks for your business!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Thanks! That squares us.



Here's your item, as promised. Hold out
both of your hands...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So, by trading your goods for my goods,
you and I have formed a merchant's oath.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So, from this moment forward I shall honor
our merchant's oath by sending shipments
of my product to the Windfall Island Shop.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Thanks again!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hmmmmmm, now...
I would have to say that I've never seen
your face before. Have I?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...Hmmm, now. Intriguing. Beguiling.
I know you're just a small child, but I've
found one can rarely trust strangers.
Where is it you've come from, young sir?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I'm sorry, but the years have made me wary.
Once, long ago, I rented a room out to a
traveler for a single night. The next dawn,
my precious Picto Box was stolen...
Tell me, young sir, why are good deeds so
often repaid with cruelty? I spread kindness
where I can, and still my box does not
come back to me. It is a sad thing.
You may look like a child, but you can see
why I cannot be assured of your youth.
Be a good boy, and be gone! Shoo! Shoo!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Of course, I have countless Picto Boxes,
but I do not want any of them stolen from
me. My heart could not take another loss.

Now, shoo! Shoo!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Why, young sir...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I must say, you seem to be in possession
of a very fine Picto Box there!
Are you a lover of pictographs, as well?

There can be no villains amongst the ranks
of Picto Box-lovers! Take your time.
Look around, I implore you![?]
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hmmmmmm now.... My, but yours is a finely
crafted Picto Box!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I once had a Picto Box of that quality...
I would have liked to have had the chance
to compare it to yours.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You see, young sir, I have been studying
Picto Boxes since I was but a lad.


My lifelong dream of creating a box with
incredible pictography capabilities is at
long last nearing fruition.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Young sir, I hesitate to ask, but... Could you
perchance become my research assistant?
Sure
Good-bye
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hrrf! Well, I never! Kids these days!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh-ho! Really? Really and truly?!
My heart leaps at your enthusiasm, but I
feel I must tell you...the path an assistant
must follow is not a simple one!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I demand that whosoever takes on the role
of my assistant be an individual who can
take whatever command I may issue and
promptly complete it without hesitation.
It will be quite a challenge, I assure you.
Are you still sure you want to do this?
Absolutely
Forget it
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hahhh! You must share my love of the
pictograph! What is your name, young sir?

[player_name], is it...?
Very well then. I shall issue three
commands to you. On the dawn of the day
you complete all three tasks, you shall
be my number-one assistant, [player_name]!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Now then! For my first command...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
A love letter.
...Do you know what that is, young sir?
It is a collection of words of love,
long unspoken and put into written form.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Somewhere in this town, there is one who,
despite constant rejection, never learns the
cold lesson of unrequited passion and
continues to write letters of doomed love.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I am certain the object of this sadly
one-sided affection is in quite a quandary
over the matter. I am of the mind that I
must have a word with the unwanted suitor.
However, I must have physical evidence.
And thus, your first task is to snap a
pictograph of this individual in the act
of sending the unwanted letters!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...That sounds easy, does it not?
Rightly so. If you hope to be my assistant,
you must perform this task with ease!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Somewhere in this town, there is one who,
despite constant rejection, never learns
love's cruelest lesson and continues to
write love letters without rest.
I need you to recover proof of this sad
story by catching this person in the act.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Be sure to take a clear full-body shot so I
can see exactly what is going on. And, of
course, so as not to be seen, you should
take the pictograph from a distance, yes?
Now, to prove you have completed this
task, you should set your Picto Box to
[Y], [Z], or [X] and press that button to show
me the pictograph. Clear, young sir?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Very well! Next is my second command.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You must search for this town's most timid
and cowardly resident. I intend to flog his
spirit so as to lend him some backbone.

This individual flinches and jumps at even
the slightest of surprises. I need you to
capture the instant of pure fear on this
individual's face in a pictograph.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So, tell me, do you think you can complete
this task, young sir?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You must search for the town's most timid
and cowardly resident. You must witness
this individual in a moment of weakness,
flinching in fear.
And as this poor creature cowers, you must
capture the moment in a pictograph.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Since this person's face alone will not tell
the complete story, you must snap a head-
to-toe pictograph so I can see the moment
the fear reverberates through the soul.
So, tell me, do you think you can complete
this more difficult second task, young sir?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Very good! Next is, at long last, my final
command! Open your heart and mind and
listen to what I say...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Somewhere in town is a couple, a man and
woman whose hearts are secretly filled with
thoughts of the other, and yet for reasons
unknown, the two have never spoken.
Even when they happen, by chance, to pass
each other in the road, they each steal a
brief, furtive glance of the other, but
they suppress the longing in their hearts...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I cannot let this tragedy go on any longer!
For the sake of the town and my own desire
to help these two poor souls...
I shall become Cupid, archer of love!
These two are timid burglars in the house
of love...and you must capture a pictograph
of them thinking their furtive thoughts!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
And young master [player_name]...
If and when, hope beyond hope, you
manage to complete this third task...
Then shall you be my number-one pupil!
Oh ho ho ho ho! Does that not excite you?
...Good luck to you, young sir!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
In this town is a couple whose hearts are
secretly filled with thoughts of one another,
but when they pass on the street, they only
gaze at one another and speak not...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You must capture in a pictograph this
secret couple, at that frozen moment
when they think their furtive thoughts
of one another!
Ah, yes, yes! There is one more thing.
Be sure to capture them both in perfect
full-body shots. Their faces alone will
not tell the full story of their love.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
From here onward, come rain or wind,
my heart shall rest in comfortable ease.
And at the same time, your heart will
learn the love that pictography fosters!
Oh ho ho ho ho ho ho!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
My assistant, [player_name]! Allow me a
brief query. Do you perchance know about
pictographs with color?

I have researched this concept for many
years, and at long last I understand it!
A stronger light is needed to imbue color
in the pictograph. No normal light will do.
In fact, normal light must be overcome!
Color pictography requires a light of the
very brightest intensity!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Now, I have heard tales of a mystical
creature in a place called the Forest Haven.
It is said to be the tiniest of creatures,
one that unleashes an otherworldly light...
As an aid to me and my research, could
you possibly use an empty bottle to capture
one of these creatures of legend?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ah, young [player_name]... Are pictographs
not the most divine of creations? You know
it is true, my young sir!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You, too, must snap and snap and snap
pictographs until you, like me, finally arrive
at the very pinnacle of pictography!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hmmm, now? Are you offering me this
thing? Sadly, I have no need of it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What's this, now?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Is... Is that...?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...Why, I feared the secret light had been
extinguished forever! Is that truly one of
the long-fabled Forest Fireflies?!
Oh, glory!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
My fine assistant, [player_name]...
For ages, it has been said that the
Forest Fireflies possess a mystical power.

For your efforts, I shall place this one
inside your box! Come on now, hand me
your Picto Box, if only for a moment...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh-ho! Now, those pictographs of yours
that have forever lacked the scintillating
palette of life should henceforth show the
world as it was meant to be_in living color!
Hmm, now... That was quite an easy thing to do after all!



...Ah, well. Such is life. Now go out there
and snap pictographs. Snap them in color
for me, for all the years I spent unable to
do so! Go to it, [player_name]!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I am a bit of a purist when it comes to
pictographs. I'm sorry, but skill such as
yours would require much polish before I'd
consider you for the position of assistant.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hmm... That's not quite right.
I'm terribly sorry, but there is no way
I could possibly give this a passing grade.
I'm afraid you must retake the shot!
When you snap a pictograph, you must be
sure not to snap it too close-up, and yet,
at the same time it should not be too
zoomed-out...
All of which means you must begin your
study of the pictography basics anew.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh-ho! Now THIS is a finely snapped
pictograph indeed! Hmmm now...
They say love is blind, but what could he
be thinking, mailing all these letters?
I should not ridicule him, though, for he
reminds me of myself back in the innocence
of my youth... Memories of those bittersweet
summer days come rushing back to me...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But I digress...
Very good, young sir! I must congratulate
you on...passing your first test!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I shall promptly take this pictograph from
you and use it most efficiently!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh-ho! Now THIS is a finely snapped
pictograph indeed! Clearly this individual
must be the town's most timid of denizens!
Fear is his constant companion!
I cannot complain, young sir! You have
passed in a most admirable manner!
...Say, and is it me, or is this chap quite
the striking individual?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Very good, young sir! And this means you
have passed my second test!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
To take the finest of pictures, you must
spend your days devoted to the path of
pictography, [player_name]! My young sir...
...My assistant!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh-ho! This is a finely snapped pictograph
indeed! ...I had no idea these two would
get along so splendidly! You can see the
love there, hidden but thriving.
Even I, who have lived in this town for so
many long years, did not realize in the
slightest the extent of their passion.
You have done well, [player_name].
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Now then, my young sir... You have
completed all of the tasks I set you to.


My doubts about you have all been cleared
up! I shall hereby be proud to call you my
assistant, [player_name]!

And to reward you further for your fine
efforts, I offer you this! The elderly lady
next door tells me it has value, of sorts.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
From here onward, come rain or wind,
my heart shall rest in comfortable ease.
And at the same time, your heart will
learn the love that pictography fosters!
Oh ho ho ho ho ho ho!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ahh, pictographs.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh ho ho ho ho ho ho ho!
Aren't these some finely snapped
pictographs? You must admit it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...But come now! You needn't be so
surprised, my young sir!


It is a hobby of mine to sneak up behind
people when they least expect it. It's quite
an amusing diversion. Think nothing of it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
By the way, the pictographs you see
decorating these fine walls have all been
taken by none other than myself.
They are my pride and joy!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You see, in my younger days I was tireless,
sailing far and wide across the Great Sea,
snapping pictographs wherever I went...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Have a look at them, young sir!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What is this a pictograph of, you ask?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Well, those are creatures called ChuChus.
They are said to have medicinal properties,
so they are a most important resource
treasured by sailors the world over.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Why, there is even said to be an extremely
rare species of them known as the Blue
ChuChu. It is only under very unusual
circumstances that they are ever sighted.
...You would be most lucky to ever
come across one, young sir!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
This is a pretty nice pictograph.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
This one is of a tiny rock islet resting
far out in the seas southeast of here.
Isn't it nice?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
There was a very dignified butler standing
before the door, and I snapped his photo
without even thinking... That aside, I am
certain this is someone's private cabana.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
This is an incredible pictograph.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I saw this strange platform rising up out of
the seas, seeming to claw at the sky.
...It makes for an even stranger silhouette.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I wonder if such things still remain out
there on the high seas, lonely on the waves.
Ah, if I only had the chance, I would love
to see these things once again...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
This is a pictograph of a place I
once visited.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Isn't it a finely snapped shot? I took it
in my younger days. It is Outset Island.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It is the most delightful of fishing villages,
innocent and rich with nature's bounty...
It was there I met a beautiful young lass...

Although I suppose she is probably not
as young as she used to be these days...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What kind of pictograph is this, you ask?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
One ill-fated day, misfortune befell me and
my boat was destroyed. Clinging to the
wreckage, I drifted at the whims of the
waves... That's when I saw this monstrosity.
This foul ship, veiled in mist and fading
in and out of sight like something of
another world... Yes, my young sir...
'Tis none other than the Ghost Ship!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The rumors I've heard tell of a man who
researched the reaches of the sea where
the Ghost Ship faded in and out of sight,
and that he drew a map of its movements.
But it is said that as soon as the man had
finished drawing the lines of that cursed
map...he died a most unexpected death.
...Chilling! Truly chilling!
Now, if one were able to find that map...
then it might be possible to sneak onto
the Ghost Ship and get the treasure that
is said to lurk within its hull!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
This pictograph chills me to the bone...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The Forsaken Fortress!



This place lies to the northwest of our fair
isle, but it has been enveloped in filthy
dark clouds of late. What are we to do
against the silent evil that lingers there?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If you value your life, young sir, then at
the very least you should stay as far away
from that place as you possibly can.

...It feels as if evil that is not of this world
lies in wait there, biding its time.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Not a bad pictograph, hm?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Is that not a rather mysterious statue?
The statue's home is on one of the Triangle
Islands. It lies due south of here.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
There are a total of three Triangle Islands:
the Northern, the Southern, and the Eastern
Triangle Islands... Each of them has a
statue such as this standing on its shores.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Does this not make a fine pictograph?



It is the epitome of pictography: not too
close-up, yet not too zoomed-out to discern
the subject. It boasts perfect balance of
scale, wouldn't you say?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What's the secret to snapping a fine
pictograph, you ask?


Why, it is to stand back at a slight
distance and to capture your subject
framed in just the right manner.

If the Picto Box is too zoomed-in, you
cannot discern what the subject is, correct?
That is why such pictographs are rarely
considered to be fine snapshots.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ah, the conditions for a fine pictograph,
you ask? Well now...


Generally, you should capture your subject
from the top of his or her head to the tips
of his or her toes. Your subject should be
framed fully within the pictograph's border.
Essentially, you should just concentrate on
getting your subject as large as possible
within the frame of the pictograph.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
And with that...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Quickly now! Up above!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Greetings, O person who has surely come to
take the challenge of the big sky! This is
where you can register for the Official Rito
Tribe Bird-Man Contest!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
And now, listen. You are free to use any
means, methods or tools you have at your
disposal to help you soar through the sky.

The rules are simple: "See how far you can
fly before you crash into the roiling seas
like so much dead-weight driftwood!"
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
A banner stands now at the site where the
Great and Talented Champion, who has
flown the farthest to date, crashed into the
frothy waves in a massive splash of glory!
If you are able to pass that flag...
then YOU will be the new champion!
And you will be drenched in praise, much
as you will be drenched in sea water!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The participation fee is a mere 10 Rupees!
Well? Will you take the challenge?
I will
Not right now
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ahh, do you not feel the grand romance of
the wide open skies? The roaring invitation
of the wind? The soft call of the clouds?
You are a boring, boring creature.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ru... Ru... Rupees! You do not have
enough Rupees, my empty-pocketed friend!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ohhhhh-kayyy! Then up the ladder you go!
My brother awaits you up top!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Uh, you don't seem to have any wings or
feathers or anything on your back...


So...you do have something that you can
use to fly, right? I sure hope so.
Here's wishing the wind beneath your,
uh...thing! Whatever it is!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Do you want to fly again, young fledgling?
The entrance fee is only 10 Rupees!
I'll fly
Not right now
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Your current record is [?].
May you return as feathered and winged as
a bird of the skies!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Come back any time you have...time!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...Uh, what was that?! That was so terrible,
I don't even know where to begin offering
advice! I could have fallen unconscious and
done better than that!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hmm... [?]?
That's...not impressive.


At the very least you ought to be paying
attention to the direction of the wind
when you fly. Think!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[?]? I suppose that's about average.
By which I mean, not even remotely in the
league of the great and talented.

Say, have you ever thought of flying into
any of the updrafts you see out there?
They can really boost your distance.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[?]?
Well, you have some skill_that much is for
certain. But let me teach you the secrets
to pushing your distance further.
First of all, the wind has to be blowing
directly toward your goal. That's the only
time you should be flying. Secondly, use the
updrafts, and use them well.
Keep these two techniques in your head
when you fly... Just don't tell my brother
upstairs! Trade secrets, you know!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[?]!?! Really???
Wow! That's some great flying...but not
quite great AND talented!

I have no more advice to share with you.
All that's left is to cast your luck to
the wind and just fly! Fly, boy, fly!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Flight distance was:
[?]!


Yes! A whopping [?]!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Amazing... You blew past my brother's
best record in impressive fashion!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You would make a fine and distinguished
member of the Rito Tribe! I guarantee it!
The former champion upstairs says so, too!
You are both great and talented!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So, as the new champion of the Bird-Man
Contest, please accept this great and
talented prize!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Come back anytime you feel the desire
to fly again! I shall await with one eye
on the sky and the other on the sea!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
We should have expected as much, 
O champion! Another stupendous flight!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
This is just a trifling thing, but please
accept it!

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Your current record is your superb flight of
[?]! All hail!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
O Great and Talented Champion!
You've come again! Would you like to fly?
I'll fly
Not right now
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, how lamentable!
..Where was your skill, O champion!?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh! A challenger! The contest is afoot!



You see that banner far off in the distance?
That marks the record distance set by our
Great and Talented Champion!
...You must pass that banner!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You can use whatever means, methods and
tools you have at your disposal! All you
must do is take to the skies and aim for
that flag, plain and simple!
Just imagine you are flying down from the
very summit of Dragon Roost Mountain!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Have you finished all your stretching
exercises? Is the wind blowing the way
you like? Is your ballast balanced?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Once you have performed all your preflight
checks, step onto that launch pad and take
flight like an elegant creature of the air!

The banner you see out yonder marks the
record set by our Great and Talented
Champion! ...You must pass it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Your current record is [?]!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh! You are the New and Great and
Talented Champion who surpassed even me!


Please show us humble brothers yet another
great flight! I tremble with anticipation!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Have you seen the small metal pedestals all
around town? We call those Joy Pedestals.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yeah, they got installed a little while ago
by the newly formed Joyous Volunteer
Association. It's part of this grand plan to
help decorate the town.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Anyway, they're brilliant! I may as well tell
you that both myself and Zunari, the guy
who runs that stall over there, are members.
You just have to be a part of stuff like this!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hey there, little joy junior! Thanks so much
for being a Joyous Volunteer!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Wow! Windfall just seems to be filled with
joy lately... Don't you think?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Say, you haven't been cooperating with the
volunteers, have you? You know what I'm
talking about? Decorating the town?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, really? ...You have? Wow, it never fails
to amaze me how kind and thoughtful folks
can be. ...I know! I'll return your kindness
with some of my own!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I hope you'll continue to help the
Joyous Volunteer Association with its work,
little joy junior!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Now I get it... You're secretly assisting the
Joyous Volunteer Association, aren't you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yeah, I've been a member for a while now,
so I can just tell these things. And being
a member is so rewarding! Spreading joy is
something you just HAVE to experience!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The Joy Pedestals are set out so that
people can place little joyful objects in
them and decorate the town.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The items you can place in them should be
on sale over there, so try asking Zunari
about the whole deal. Honestly, you're
missing out if you don't take part!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Whoa! Don't startle me like that!
...Sheesh! I thought we were having an
earthquake or something!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Both Mila and Maggie returned unharmed!



It sounds as though they went through
quite an ordeal, but they're safe now.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, the horribleness! I don't know what I'd
do if I were kidnapped and taken to the
Forsaken Fortress! Just the thought of it
sends shivers down my spine! Brrrr!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Lately, I've been hearing that monsters from
the Forsaken Fortress have been going
around kidnapping girls with long ears.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I can believe it. After all, two girls from
Windfall have already been kidnapped. Poor
Maggie and Mila... It just breaks my heart
to think about those two.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Both of their fathers are desperate to find
anyone who can rescue their poor little
girls... What kind of world has this
become?! So much fear and suffering...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Tee hee hee!
Tell me, little boy...
Can you control the wind?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hee hee! So young, to have such power...
How did you know to find me here?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I am the queen of the fairy world!



What is the matter, my child?
Does that not surprise you? Young one...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I like you.



And so, I shall give new power to the
bow that you wield.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

I must tell you... You are just my type.
Tee hee hee!

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Thanks to you, I have been freed from
that beast's foul grasp...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
As thanks, I shall give you just a little
of my power...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

May the winds of fortune always blow
across your bow...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

In the place where the wind god guides
you, you will find one who can grant new
power to the Hero's Bow that you wield.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...Power that can freeze fierce flames and
melt the coldest ice.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
When you find you have need of such
power, you must call upon the powers of
the wind god.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh! A fine welcome to you, young person
that I've never seen before!


You're so lucky to meet me at this time!
This shop will close in just seven more
days, and I'm having a clearance sale.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I'm going to be closing very soon, so if you
want to buy something, you'd better buy it

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I didn't lie! I closed...and completely redid
the inside of my shop. Tah-dah! It's reborn!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What? I have nothing to talk about...
Just buy something, huh?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What's that? Why would I know what that
is? I'm not Beedle! Or whatever his name is!
Don't show me that!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If you have time to show me that, then
you're not doing what you should be!
Stop fooling around!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
OHHHHH! I'm sad to say that this shop will
close in just six short days.


Right now, I'm having my clearance sale.
Great deals to be had!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Sorry about that!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
OHHHHH! Hey! I've been waiting for you!



These scurvy pirates sold me some bombs
for cheap! This may be your only chance!
Buy buy buy!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
By the way, are you friends with that
adorable little kid?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ohhh, you're pretty smart for someone with
such a young face, huh?
Yuk yuk yuk yuk yuk!

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
We close today! Which means this is the
last day for our clearance sale! Which
means that you'd better buy buy BUY!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I don't have anything for sale at the
moment, but I'm constantly looking for
things that I can sell at good prices JUST
to you. I'm serious! I'm not lying!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Have I ever tricked you before?
Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Of course not! So believe me! Just wait a

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I'm sorry, I wasn't listening just now...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What? I couldn't hear you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I'm sorry, I don't understand the words
that you use. What language is that?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
OHHHHH! You're absolutely right! I've never
fooled you! Not even one time! Not once!
Thank you so much for believing me!

________________________________________
Hmmm... Well, that's not quite enough...
I know! If you could collect 20 of them for
me, I'll give you something quite splendid.

Yes! That's your homework for today, dear!
Collect 20 of them!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It's just not in my nature to do such
scrounging for jewelry... But you can do it,
can't you? Please wrap me in the pure joy
of 20 of those delightful things!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Why, to think a child like you would pay
such a large tribute to me...


Oh, your teacher is very impressed by
your efforts, little dear! My whole body
is numb with the thrill of excitement!
...So this is what pure joy feels like!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I'll take precisely 20 of them, thank you.
That will do just fine! My heart will be
all aflutter! I don't know if you know,
but 20 is my lucky number!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
And just as I promised, I will reward you
for going out and collecting all these for
me. I'm going to give you...

A wonderfully splendid thing!
Close your eyes, dear...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Dum-dah-DUM!



You see, although I am but a mere teacher, I
own my very own cabana in a tropical
oasis down south. But lately I haven't
made use of it at all, so you can have it!
Ooh hoo hoo hoo hoo! It's all right, dear.
You can stop gaping in amazement now!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Now that you have this deed, that cabana
is all yours! You OWN it! So whatever
you do, don't lose this piece of paper!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I am getting on in age, and sea travel
hasn't exactly agreed with me as of late...
Now I can just stay here and relax as I
continue my work with the children.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
And just so you know, you'll find the place
southeast of here! It's on a tiny, lonely little
isle near the Triangle Islands.

From now on, it is your own little
bachelor pad! Good luck finding it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, and one more thing...
Don't tell ANYBODY, dear!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
My dear! Did you bring me Joy Pendants
yet again?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hmm... Are you giving these to me as well?
But I told you I was perfectly satisfied
with the 20 you gave me before!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But my, you are such a persistent little
dear! Since you are so insistent, I will
accept them happily!  ...Fine! I have no
choice but to unleash pure joy on you!
Prepare for an onrush of joy the likes
of which you've never imagined!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You got the Hero's Charm!
This mystical trinket gives you the
ability to see the life forces of your
foes!
Equip it on the Quest Status screen!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hey, sounds like you apologized to the
Teach' for us! Good ol' Mrs. Marie!
...And speakin of, bud, did you know it's
gonna be Mrs. Marie's birthday soon?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Boss! Ooh! Boss!
You think maybe we should we give her
some kinda present or something?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Don't be stupid! We're the Killer Bees!
We ain't no teacher's pets!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yeah, but Teach' loves jewelry and junk
more than anythin' else in the world!


What's she into these days?
What'd she call 'em? Joy Pendants?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Really? Where do you find 'em? Are they
just lyin' around? If we could just find
some, we could give 'em to Teach' as a
present, and she'd be all happy...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hey... Now that I think about it, when I was
climbin' trees the other day, I saw some
sparkly light up on top of some tree
in town. Where was that...?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Maybe that's one of them pendants!
What d'ya think, Boss...?
Nah! That's crazy-talk!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yo, bud! Looks like you found yourself
a Joy Pendant! Solid work!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Actually, I gotta admit, we hid that thing
up in the tree. We thought you might find it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Listen up! It's gonna be Mrs. Marie's
birthday soon. We were thinkin' of givin'
her a present, so it was good that we
finally got our hands on that thing...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...But we can't be goin' around givin'
presents to people! No way! That just
don't fit the Killer Bees' style!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Come on, bud! Can't you give it to Teach'
for us? Can't you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
And it's not like we could ask just anybody
to do it for us, neither. It's gotta be
someone reliable, who can keep a secret...
You're the only one we could ask, bud!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You listen, young man! I haven't seen you
around, so I guess you're new to Windfall...
but don't you know it's bad to eavesdrop on
conversations meant only for adult ears?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
We're discussing...very, VERY important
topics that kids just wouldn't understand.
You're far too young to be listening to us,
young man! So shoo!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So anyway, you know that brick building at
the top of the steps? Well, the gentleman
who lives there has SUCH class!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ooh, I KNOW! That mysterious pictographer,
Lenzo is so...dreamy! Ohhhhhhhh...
He makes my heart go aflutter!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But...do you think the rumors could be true?
Is he actually devoted to someone special?
He just seems too serious about his work to
be involved with somebody...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The lucky lady! Who could she be?! I wish
someone would take a pictograph of the
two of them together so we could see if the
rumors are true! Oh, that'd be to die for!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Well, I suppose we were all wrong about
the rumors of Lenzo and his "girlfriend"...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ahhh... I simply can NOT wait!
Tonight's auction is going to be so fun!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oooh! Oooh! The excitement! The drama!
Just wondering who's going to win the
bidding race tonight gives me goosebumps!
...I'm not sure I can wait until dark!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I'm going to be the auction star tonight,
I just know it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
They call those pictographs. I know all
about those things. ...That one's pretty nice.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, you mean Lenzo and the lady who loves
pictographs? Yes, yes, I already know
about that.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
OH! 
This is...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It's the pictographer, Lenzo, and that
pictograph-loving lady!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I guess we were completely wrong about
Lenzo having a girlfriend...


It looks as though they're just old friends
who happen to share the same hobby.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Thanks for setting us straight, young man.
We really should stop spreading idle
gossip like that.

...You've taught us the error of our ways,
and to thank you, we're going to give you
something nice. Stick out your hand!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
My naughty little boy found this
somewhere. I'm sure you'll like it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You look like a curious boy... Did you know
there's an island a little to the east of
here called Dragon Roost Island?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Folks say that the island is the home of a
tribe of people who dance in the skies like
birds on the wind. They call themselves the
Rito, and they say a sky spirit lives nearby.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But...to someone like me, a person who's
never left this little island, it may as well
be a fairy tale out of a child's book.
...Oh, if only I had my own boat!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Dragon Roost Island...
I'd surely love to go there some day. They
say it's only a little ways to the east...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The sky-dancing Rito tribe... A mystical
sky spirit... Dragon Roost Island just
sounds like a paradise floating in the
ocean of my dreams!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Is... Is... Is that...your boat?
Well, that's startling!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Umm, if I may suggest something, I'd prefer
you to take my pictograph from the front...


I'll certainly have no complaints if you take
a perfect shot of me from my face down to,
oh, say...my hips! Yes, that would do nicely!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Well, that's an excellent pictograph of me!
...I'm amazed! Usually, I look awful on film!


Oh, but...somehow my complexion just
doesn't look right. Maybe that's because
it's a black and white pictograph...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, yes! Look at my face!
...How charming!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Well, is this how I look today?
...Why, I had no idea that the gloss on my
skin was so...perfect!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Just LOOK at me! I am so stunning!
...Oh, I feel so wonderful now!


I have to reward you for making me
feel so good about myself! Here!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
My son picked it up somewhere, and I
would imagine you like this sort of thing,
correct? My son likes it, so you must, too!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If you could indulge me for a moment,
please admit that I am looking FINE!
Why, looking this fine would have won me
the Miss Windfall crown way back when!
I'm STILL looking better than all the
younger girls I know! Hoo hoo hoo!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, hoo hoo hoo! And how do I look today?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
My skin will always be beautiful!



Hoo hoo hoo! Not even the younger girls
look prettier than me!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You know, HE always shows off his pictures
of me just as soon as he's taken them.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...What?! I'll have you know I've only come
here to have him take a pictograph of my
exceptionally beautiful skin!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I've been a huge fan of pictographs for a
long time now...


So don't go taking this the wrong way! 
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Allow me to think... Ah. Yes. I first started
searching for pictographs that recorded
true beauty...oh, about ten years ago...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
How interesting!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hah?
...Who's there?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Wh-Wh-Wh-What are you doing here?
Were you trying to give me a heart attack?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hmm... And now that I think on it, just how
did you get in here? Why, I never even
noticed you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Well, if that isn't a Joy Pendant! Wait...
Are you trying to say that I look even
more fabulous when I wear jewelry?

Why, you delightful little rascal!
Tee hee!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You learned the Command Melody!

They look like they might be a little

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hey there, boy! Did you happen to see the
postbox down near the docks?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Well, just so you know, if you want to send
someone a letter, just set it to [Y], [Z], or [X],
and use that button to put it in the
postbox. It's just that easy.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Before long, the Rito postman will come to
deliver it to whomever you've sent it to.
He's a hardworking fellow, I tell you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I wonder if the Rito postman has already
come today...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Let's see... Was that all I needed to send?
I didn't forget anything, did I?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Dang! I DID forget to send something!
What a drag...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Awwww... What are you doing, taking
pictures like this?


I'd only send something like this to my
future wife!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I don't feel guilty at all!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh! A pictograph!



You know, there's a famed pictographer
living in the red brick building in town.
Have you been to see him yet?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Welcome!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, my! You're a very small customer,
aren't you? Well, that's fine, of course.
You just feel free to look around!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, can I help you with something?
Let's talk
Maybe next time
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Well, 'bye!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You know, the world's a crazy place, kiddo.
You're still young, so you probably don't
know about what goes on out there beyond
the comfortable confines of your home.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Listen to this... The other night, a gang
of gangly pirates came into my shop
without any warning, and do you want to
know what they did?
Well, I'll tell you! They said, "Hey! You!
You'll be renting your little place out to us
tonight! You got that?!" I had no choice!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
And that night, they stayed up all night
drinking coffee, singing strange pirate
songs of "love and loss" (whatever THAT
means), and generally causing a ruckus!
...Now THEY were a troublesome bunch!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If I look a little worried, it's just because
my pop's been sick and bedridden for a
long time now.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
That's why I'm stuck managing this cafe!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It's taken me a while, but I think I'm finally
getting the hang of running this place.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
When night falls around here, this place
fills up with all these sour, swarthy sailors.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
In fact, there's this little boat called the
Shop Ship that shows up at night and
cruises around the island selling things.
I'm not sure what the story is with that.
I guess what I'm trying to tell you here is
that this town has two faces: the nice,
pretty one you see in the day and the
darker, shadier one you see at night.
...But I suppose that's too heavy a concept
for a youngster like yourself, eh?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Shhh! Keep quiet! ...This is no time for a kid
like you to be coming in here!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You don't want to get hurt, do you?
Just be a good kid and go home, OK?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Just a second, there, kid! ...Look, this isn't
any time for a kid like you to be coming
in here! Just trust me, OK?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Go on, now! Go home!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Fine night, isn't it?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You know, this thing may look like a
windmill, but it's actually a wind-powered
ferris wheel! It used to harness the wind's
power to spin in quite a nifty manner...
But we rarely get a favorable wind around
here anymore, so it doesn't budge.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I'm pretty sure it's not broken or anything,
though, so if the wind blew in the right
direction again, we'd just have to hit the
power switch out back to get it moving.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Whoa! That's a pretty incredible wind
we've got blowing right now!


But...the funny thing about this ferris wheel
is the fact that it doesn't matter how strong
the breeze is_it still won't budge unless
someone presses the power switch!
I don't know why they didn't just make it
work like a regular old windmill.
That would have been way better!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hmmm... It looks like a southeasterly wind
is blowing right now.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hmm... It looks like a southwesterly wind
is blowing now.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hmm... It looks like an easterly wind is
blowing now.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hmmm... It looks like a westerly wind is
blowing now.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ummm... It looks like a northerly wind is
blowing now.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hmm... It looks like a northeasterly wind
is blowing now.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Umm... It looks like a northwesterly wind is
blowing now.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Do you see that, little man? The light in
the lighthouse has been reignited! Check
out the beam of light that sweeps out now,
shining through the night's darkness!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Seeing that brave beam fighting the gloom
has made me so happy, I just feel like
giving somebody a present. So, here! I'm
giving this to you, little man!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Now Windfall is going to be even more
lively than before! Hurray for everything!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Well, would you look at that! The ferris
wheel just started moving all on its own!
Somebody must have started it up.

I wonder who got the thing going again?
I don't know who it was or where he is, but
he must be one nice guy_assuming, of
course, that he IS a guy.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Well, seeing as how it's finally moving
again, you should go for a ride while you
have the chance.

You can jump into the gondola seats just
around the corner from here! Trust me,
little man, it's fun.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
This tower was originally used as a
lighthouse for Windfall Island, you know.


Yeah, it used to send a bright shaft of light
onto the night sea_sort of a safety beacon.
...But that was quite some time ago.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Even now, what's left of that lighthouse's
illumination device still spins around up
top, all night, every night.
...But its fire remains extinguished.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Isn't that a sad story? And it doesn't have
to be. I bet that thing would light up again
if someone could just get a spark of fire
inside it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Looking out from the top of a lighthouse
is the best! Don't you agree, little man?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name]... [player_name]...
Wake up, [player_name]!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Pull yourself together, [player_name]!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Well? Have you come to your senses yet?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You are surprisingly dull-witted...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Did I startle you?



I suppose that is only natural. As wide
as the world is, I am the only boat upon
it who can speak the words of men.

I am the King of Red Lions.
Do not fear... I am not your enemy.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name]...



I have been watching you since you went to
the Forsaken Fortress to rescue your sister.


I understand how your desire to protect
your sister could give you the courage to
fearlessly stand up to anything...

But such a bold attempt was foolhardy!



I suppose you saw him... The shadow that
commands that monstrous bird...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
His name is...Ganon...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...He who obtained the power of the gods,
attempted to cover the land in darkness,
and was ultimately sealed away by the
very power he hoped to command.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
He is the very same Ganon...
The emperor of the dark realm the ancient
legends speak of...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I do not know why the seal of the gods has
failed, but now that Ganon has
returned, the world is once again being
threatened by his evil magic.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Tell me, [player_name]...
Do you still wish to save your sister
from him?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
And will you do anything to save her?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...I see.



In that case, I shall guide you as we go
forward...advising you on what you should
do, and where you must go.

Ganon cannot be defeated by human
hands, let alone by what little strength
you possess.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The key to defeating Ganon is locked
away in a great power that you can wield
only after much toil and hardship.

Do you understand?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
In that case, we depart!
To the Great Sea!
...Ah, but I am getting ahead of myself.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
This is actually a bit embarrassing for me
to admit, but...although I am indeed a boat
that possesses the power of speech...
I possess no sail.
And a boat with no sail can sail no seas.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I have brought you far to the east of the
dark gaze of the Forsaken Fortress. On this
island is a town of merchants who deal in
a wide variety of goods.
If you search hard enough, surely you can
find one who will sell you a sail.


I am sorry to ask this of you, but without
a sail, I will be useless to you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
This island of merchants is home to many
valuable goods.


While the sail must come first, do not feel
limited to buying only it. Once you have it,
feel free to stock up on anything else you
think you may need.
But remember: there is no time to play.
Come back here immediately as soon as
your errands are done.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It is just as the postman told us.
The pirate ship has stopped here to avoid
drawing the attention of the townsfolk...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I know not what they are researching, but
if they are hoping to get their hands on
Jabun's sacred gem...

I doubt they would tell you anything
directly if you were to ask them.


[player_name], I think you should try to
find out what the pirates are up to...
without them finding out about you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What is the matter? Go see what the
pirates are doing, and come back as
quickly as you can.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What is the matter, [player_name]?



...Have you forgotten the password?



It's simple. It's [var. Password]!



And remember, once you hear a password...
do your best not to forget it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Well done! Our preparations are complete.



If what the girl says is true, the pirates
won't be leaving until morning.


You must meet with Jabun and get the pearl
from him before they arrive.


Let us delay no longer, [player_name]!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
There is no one playing music nearby.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Medli, listen carefully to what I am about
to tell you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The temple ahead is the nest of an evil
creature...the same creature that stole the
life of your predecessor, the sage.
It is a dark and frightening place.
That is why, if you do nothing else,
then at least do this...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If [player_name] comes near you and
presses [R] to call you, then be silent,
and follow closely behind him.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
And if [player_name] presses [A], allow
him to lift you, and if need be, fly and
carry him through the air.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
And [player_name]...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If Medli gets stuck and cannot continue in
the temple, use the Wind Waker to conduct
the song you learned in the Tower of the
Gods. Do you understand?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name], protect Medli.
And Medli, protect [player_name].


The power to repel evil shall surely be
returned to the Master Sword!

Well? What do you think about my outfit?
...You don't see clothes like this often,
do you? Aren't they so cute?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
A friend of mine who lives on Outset Island
sent this outfit to me.


She's an amazing girl. She can put jars on
her head and walk around like it's nothing
at all! You have to see it to believe it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You know something? When you stand here,
you see a lot of different people pass by.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
This is a brand-new outfit, you know.
I just wish someone would notice it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Actually, there's a fella I've had my eye on lately.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
He's got such a distinguished chin...
And he's always walking back and forth.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hey, I've had something on my mind ever
since the pictographer who lives in the red
brick building told me my fortune.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
He told me that if I send a beautiful
pictograph of myself to the one who has
captured my heart, true love will blossom
in return...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So I couldn't help but notice...that you
have a Picto Box of your own, don't you?
Do you think you could take a pictograph
of me to the apple of my eye?
Maybe he'll notice my affections...
Leave it to me!
Keep me out of this!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Really?! How splendid!



Be sure to get my good side!



Oh! I want to show off this outfit, so
don't just take a pictograph of my face.
Can you be sure to get my whole body in
the pictograph?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Well, that's just plain mean!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
After you do your little "CLICK! CLICK!"
and take my pictograph, be sure to take
it to him for me!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Then surely...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Maybe... He'll come tomorrow!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The two of us...are going to start dating!
Don't we make a delightful couple?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I'm so happy! And that's why I want to
share some of our happiness with you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Take good care of it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You delivered my pictograph, didn't you?
Well, it looks like that was what brought us
together... Thank you so much!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Thanks to you, Anton and I have grown so
close to one another.
...Thank you so much!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You...don't look at all familiar, buddy.
Are you some kind of tourist or something?
If you are, I'll show you around_why don't
you join me for a little stroll around town?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Our Windfall Island may be a little cozy,
so to speak, but people from all over the
world come here. The town's always lively.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ha ha! Why, just walking around and
having a look at things is quite fun!
THAT'S the mark of a great town!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So anyway, taking strolls is kind of like a
hobby of mine. I'm always moving, buddy!
...But do you think it's strange for a young
guy like me to walk around so much?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Well, whatever. I'll tell you one thing:
Because I take so many strolls, I know all
the best walking courses in town.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Take that little path beside the bomb shop,
for example. How many people in town know
that it kind of sneaks around behind the
building? I think I'm the only one, buddy!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I tell you, every time I walk by, she kind of
gives me that look... You know that look I'm
talking about? What do you suppose that
look could mean...?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
There's this certain someone that I've had
my eye on lately. I don't know her name,
but boy, oh boy...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Whenever I think about her, my heart just
starts fluttering in my chest. I've never
felt anything like this before...

You think I'm catching a cold, buddy?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
That's it! I've made up my mind! First,
I'm going to ask her out for coffee, then,
if things seem to be going right, I'm going
to profess my love for her!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Urrgh... I just can't seem to settle down.
I'm so nervous... I mean, just when am I
supposed to invite her out, buddy?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hey! It's you! Listen to this, will you?
I...DID...IT! I worked up my courage, and
I talked to her, and it was totally the
right move!
You know why, buddy? She likes me!
She actually likes me!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Everything's coming up roses for me...
Life IS good, buddy!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I'm so happy! And you, Linda...
You're so swell!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh! A pictograph, eh, buddy?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Say... Speaking of pictographs, did you
know we have a famous pictographer living
here on the island? Lenzo is his name.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Have you met him yet, buddy?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...But man, is this a terrible pictograph!
Who is this, anyway?!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...Hmm, this one's not bad, but the color
just isn't right, somehow.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Maybe because it's in black and white?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ah! This girl...!



Actually, buddy, this is the girl I've had
my eye on lately.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Wow! She really IS that pretty! I mean,
just seeing this pictograph reminds me
of how gorgeous that girl is...

But no! I'll never be happy with just a
mere pictograph! Never!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
That's it! I've made my decision! I am going
to get that girl to go out with me!
It's got to be done, buddy!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I've got it! Maybe I'll invite her to join me
at the cafe bar_for coffee, of course!


...So what's her name, anyway?
Do you think she's nice?
Does she have a steady fellow?
Ohhhhh, I'm so NERVOUS!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, that's nice, buddy!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yep, to sailors like us, the wind's our
whole life! It'd sure be nice if a fair wind
blew today...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh! There's a fair wind blowing to the west!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If you were to set sail and let this easterly
wind take you where it would, you'd end up
at a place called the Mother & Child Isles.
It's a real pleasant sail_not too far away.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But the thing is, the mother island is
pretty much surrounded by this high rock
wall. There's no way anyone'll ever get in
there...unless they can fly, of course!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, there's no fair wind blowing west
right now.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yup, we men of the sea are real sensitive
when it comes to wind direction!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Squid.



...You ever been all ate up by one o' them
squid out on the Great Sea?
Oh yeah
Nope
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Don't you go lyin', now! Why, stick any
other sailor out there in my position and
he'd be belly-up. He'd have been finished.
FINISHED, I'm tellin' you!
It's a darn good thing I'm about as
rough-and-tumble a sailor as you'll ever
meet! Oh, you better believe it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
This one time, our ship got caught in this
giant whirlpool, you get me? And what's
there waitin' for us in the middle of it?
...The giantest squid you ever seen!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
All over its body the thing had these
beady, gnarly, glowin' eyes...
And I don't even KNOW what was goin'
on with its tentacles!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...Now that I'm thinkin' on it, those were
the squirreliest eyes I ever seen! If I ever
come across that beastie again, I'll whale
him in the eyes. THAT'S what I'll do!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The sea's a fine thing, to be sure, but it's
not until I get back to town again that I
can really relax, know what I mean?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
And when I see the area around this fine-
lookin' gate we got here... Well, that's
when I really start feelin' good. Yeah,
that gate in particular just says...
"At long last, you're home, boy!"
...I s'pose that's the feelin' I'm
talkin' about. That comin'-home feelin'.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
That huge gate there at the entrance to
town is one of Windfall Island's most
famous features. No matter how much I see
it, I never get tired of it, you know?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hey, by the by, there's a statue way up
there on top of the gate that looks kinda
familiar somehow...

...Is that Zunari the Shop Master?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hey, by the by, there's a statue way up
there on top of the gate that looks kinda
familiar somehow...

Is that an idol carved in the style of the
Rito Tribe? That's a mighty nice lookin'
statue, if it is. Well, I guess it's mighty
nice even if it isn't a Rito, but still.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hey, by the by, the top of that gate is
lookin' mighty fancy, if you ask me.


...Is there some kinda festival today
or somethin'?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hey, by the by, the top of that gate is
lookin' mighty regal these days!
...A lover of flags such as myself can't
get enough of it, know what I mean?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hey, by the by, they seem to have put all
sorts of statues on top of that gate...
It's a mighty peculiar way of decoratin' the
thing, but I like it, know what I mean?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hey, by the by, don't it look like they've
tried to spice that gate up by decoratin' it
and such?

I think so, too. But whoever did it don't
have no sense of pomp and circumstance
at all, do they?!

I gotta tell you, before I became a sailor,
I wanted to be an artist, so when it comes
to ar-tis-tic expression, I'm kind of a snob,
know what I mean? A good snob.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But I gotta admit, it'd be nice to have that
gate decorated proper. You know, with a
true sense of decorative style...

Ain't there any youngsters around who
want to be artists anymore?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Look at that! It's brilliant! It makes
me so happy to see the gate like that!
...Here! I want you to have this!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What inspired you to decorate that gate?
What, are you tryin' to be an artist
or somethin'?

Well, nice work, I say! Nice work!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Heh heh...
What are you doin' in a place like this
at such a late hour?

Isn't it bedtime for all the little brats?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yeah, yeah. Step right up.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Eh?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, you again?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You like this place, eh?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Wow. Haven't seen you around here for a
while. You must be a busy little kid...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If you have confidence in your target
shooting, why don't you give this a shot?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It's 50 Rupees per game. Wanna try?
You bet
No thanks
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ah!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...Oh... Never mind... My mistake...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yeah, whatever.
Come again. Or not.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Umm, it's 50 Rupees per game...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
All right. Now then...
Ermm... EH-HEM!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh! Ho! Ho!
So, you're the little shrimp who
thinks he's a target-shooting hotshot, yeah?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
And you say this knowing full well that we
are pirates who are so frightening that
crying babies shut their mouths when we
step into the room?!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Har! This should be funny!
Fine then, hotshot!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If you can manage to sink the 5 pirate
ships you see off on the horizon, we'll
acknowledge your skills with a cannon,
you shrimpy little landlubber!
HOWEVER! We won't tolerate any comments
about how the pirate ships look like
barrels! And you get only 10 shots!
You heard me!
You can move your cannon with [+] and
fire it with [A]. Watch the water plumes
carefully when you fire, yeah?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You got it, shrimp?
I got it!
Not really...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Then clean out your ears and listen up!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If you manage to sink all 5 pirate ships,
we'll give you all the treasure we've
stolen up until now! Good luck to you,
shrimp! You'll need it, yeah?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh! Ho! Ho!
You again, shrimp!?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So, our little shrimp has returned to us.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh... Too bad.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It's 50 Rupees per game...



Want to try again?
Sure
No thanks
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Psssh!
Wow! Nice shooting...


But we won't hand over our priceless
treasure so easily, yeah?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

It's yours, so take it!

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh! I was just wondering who was out here,
and look at this! It's YOU again! Look at
you and that adorably cute face of yours!

I can't help but give away our treasure
to you. It's yours, so take it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Did that boy beat you guys again!?
Give me a break! This is ridiculous!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Are you sure a kid like you should be
playing in a seedy place like this?


Oh well, a promise is a promise! Take our
treasure! It's yours!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Y'know, laddie, if I had to give myself a
title, it'd be a Know-It-All Sailor. I'm wise.
Learned. Experienced. G'head, ask me
anything you want to know about the sea.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I know it sounds kind of odd for me to say
this about myself, but you should know that
my mood changes with the wind. I'm a
whirlwind of emotion, laddie! Aye!
...But don't let that stop you from asking
me anything you want to know! Ask away!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Right now the wind is blowing to the north.
Say, that reminds me... There's an island to
the north that blasts out mighty gusts of
wind. Aye, a mysterious place... 
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
No one can get near it... It's like the very
breath of the earth is gushing out from the
bellows of the world. I tell you, laddie,
that's no average wind!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I don't think anyone could fight through
that wind_not unless he were a real hefty
bloke. Even a guy like me would be blown
back like a feather! And I'm a burly sort!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So the wind is blowing to the northwest
now, is it? Interesting, laddie!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Aye, now that I think about it... There's a
strangely magical island northwest of here.
It's the kind of place that feels like it
came straight out of a fairy tale.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Why, I've even got mates who claim to have
seen fairies on that island...but who knows
whether they're telling the truth or not.
The boys are prone to...boasting a wee bit.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So the wind is blowing to the northeast?
A nor'easter, is it, laddie?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Y'know, when you're out at sea at night,
and you take a look at the sky, the stars
are just amazing. In fact, when the weather
is fair, you can see the Big Dipper up there.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I don't know why that just sprung to mind,
to tell you the truth. You can see the Big
Dipper anywhere, not just northeast of here.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The wind is blowing west today, laddie!
Ah, west... There's a mighty interesting
island due west of here. Aye, so there is.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
There's a gigantic cannon on it, and it's
manned by a suspicious-looking bloke.
Rumor has it, he's got something mighty
peculiar that he's showing off there.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I sure wouldn't mind taking a gander at
whatever it is myself, laddie!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So, the wind blows east, does it, laddie?
Have you seen the mountain far to the east
of this island? The volcanic isle that spews
molten lava?! Oh, not a nice place! 
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Legend tells of a powerful treasure that lies
waiting for one who can brave the very
bowels of the earth and lay claim to it!
Aye, that tale's famous amongst us sailors!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
That treasure... If the rumors are true, it can
turn you into a titan! Aye! It bestows so
much strength upon you, you could lift
stones the size of small islands, laddie!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...WHAT?!?
You already got that treasure!?
You can't be serious, laddie!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Why, I've heard just getting your hands
on that treasure makes you sturdy enough
to stand in the face of the fiercest winds!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Not many know of it, but there's an island
of ice far to the south. Aye, it's said to be
wrapped in a biting blizzard so nasty, it
can freeze visitors solid in their tracks!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But there's said to be a great treasure
hidden there, amongst the savage snows.
Or so the sailors tell...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Y'know, laddie, I've seen some odd things,
but nothing so odd as this one island. It
was far, far to the south of this town, and
it was home to this humongous head!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I've got to say, laddie, it looked to me like
that head was on watch...like there was 
something that it was guarding...
Maybe something below it...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But I never confirmed my suspicions. That
stone head was so heavy, I almost threw
my back out trying to move it! Aye, you'd
need unnatural strength to lift that thing!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So the wind blows to the southeast, does
she? Southeast...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Now that I think about it, I recall seeing the
strangest of houses on a lonely little
isle to the south. It seemed downright
out of place to me, laddie...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I don't know what kind of fool goes
building a cabana in these treacherous
seas... But whoever did it has got some
nerve, I tell you! Oh, aye!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ahhhhhhh! Nothin' better than a cup of
refreshment at your local cafe after a long
day's work... Nothin'!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
My story is a strange one... I came across
cursed seas from a land far away...a land
where the blizzards blow violently...heading
for this town called Windfall.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But dear me! As I traveled, a terrible storm
descended and tore my ship to bits...yet
mysteriously, only that escaped without
so much as a mark on it...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
From the looks of you, I would say you
are a traveler as well. Oh, yes indeed!
...Could you not purchase that from me?
It is my one and only heirloom from home.
The people of this town do not seem the
least bit interested in that, despite the
fact that it would help them travel the
dangerous seas about their town...
Please! I beg of you! I wish to open a
business here in this town, so I am in
desperate need of finances!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
How does...80 Rupees sound?
I'll buy it
I don't need it
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Why, you don't have enough Rupees!
...You are a pitiable soul yourself!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ooooooooh... Oh, dear me... Sadly, I have
nothing else I could possibly sell you.
I have naught but my hoodie coat_and it is
a keepsake from my dear, dear mother!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ooooooooh... Please buy that from me!
Please purchase my only belonging!
That is a very, very fine thing indeed!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yes, yes, yes! Thank you very much, indeed!
I have received precisely 80 Rupees for it.
I can use these funds to finance my new
business! Oh, dear me, what a happy day!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Very well, young master... As I promised,
please! Take that!!! 
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yes, yes, yes! You have made a good
purchase today, my young master!


And you have saved my life and business
as well! Treasure it dearly! It is the finest
sail in the world! Treat it as such!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Windfall is a warm and bustling place, I

carrying products, let me know! The first
thing I must do is find products to sell!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

It stinks, too, because I went to all the

her with! And now she's not around!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
My dear! Did you bring me Joy Pendants
yet again?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
How many Joy Pendants have you brought?
[?]...?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
My goodness! When I put these together
with the ones you've already brought
me, they add up to a whopping [?]!
Oh, thank you! THANK YOU! I'm so joyful!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...To receive so many mountains of these
beautiful pendants... I am quite simply
brimming with joy, my dear!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
To thank you, I have to give you my most
precious of precious belongings!
I shall give you...this very special
piece of jewelry!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Now, close your eyes, dear...
This item is so rare, there is not
another like it anywhere in the world!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What do you think? Isn't it dashing? It is
the rarest of things, and it will show you
its true worth when you wear it in the
presence of a monster.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
For now, just select it on your Quest
Status Screen to put it on.
...And when you do, promise to think of me
and treasure it with all your heart!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
My, oh my, oh my! Have you brought me
Joy Pendants again? Again? Oh, thank you,
you sweet little dear! Thank you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
My goodness! When I put these together
with the others you've given me, I now have
a total of [?]!
Why, I'm so joyful, it's frightening!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
And you, my little darling dear, you are like
the Champion of Making People Joyful!
Please, take this, you noble champion!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It's not much, but even you need some
pocket change, right, dear?

...But let's keep this just between us.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But now that I think about it, my room is
filled with these pendants now...
Are you sure you haven't been going a
little overboard with these things?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
By the way, how is your cabana?
Have you been to see it yet?


It's next to the Triangle Islands
south of here. Don't forget, dear!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
This is the Wind Waker! It is a baton of
sorts that was used long ago when the
people played music in prayer to the gods.

In those days, simply using it allowed one
to borrow the power of the gods, but
I do not know if it still works.

Even so, I thought it might be of some use
to you. Perhaps you should try using it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You know, I've been a teacher here for a
long time... It's tough to put one past me.
That being said, I'm pretty sure I know who
put you up to this, dear.
Those little sweeties! I'm so joyful! It's the
best birthday present I could ask for!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I suppose I ought to thank you!
Close your eyes, dear...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
And if you see those boys again, tell them
I say hello!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, if it's Joy Pendants, I suppose I'll take
them this time. But I think double-digit
amounts of joy are enough for me!

To be honest, I can actually only count to
99, anyway.


...But that's fine! I'm not a math teacher.


...Hey! Don't look at me like that!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
People from all over the world seem to
gather here on Windfall Island, all hoping
to become successful merchants.

I suppose you could say that this is the
island where people and money come
together. But you know what...?

Money is important, sure...but don't you
think people need to open their hearts a
little more than their wallets?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I've been kicking around this crazy world

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

I don't know where you got your mitts on
that Sea Chart you got there...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But it looks to me like it's pretty much got
nothing but seas drawn on it!


It's pathetic! In fact, it's almost an insult to
call that thing a Sea Chart, if you ask me!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What's the matter, small fry? I'm just trying
to be nice here! I'm telling you that you've
got a problem. And you do.

Don't give me that stupefied look! It makes
you look like you oughta be in diapers!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Just listen, OK? I'm here to teach you what
I know about this island, so open up your
Sea Chart! And make it snappy!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
That's all I can teach you, small fry!



But I will do this for you, since I'm feeling
so generous: I'll send word to all my
brethren living near the islands of the
Great Sea. Good bunch of fish.
If you see a fish leaping out of the water
when you sail near an island, sail up to it
and spread bait out on the water's surface.
Trust me, this is good advice, fry. 
See, the baiting process allows you to get
a chart of the island, along with any info
that might be of use to you. I HIGHLY
recommend you make a habit of doing so.
See, you're definitely going to need a
reliable Sea Chart to help you search for
things out at sea. I can't emphasize that
enough, fry. You NEED a well-drawn chart.
If you don't get a chart for every island
you come across, it'll just be a bigger
hassle for you later on! Now don't say I
never did anything for you, fry!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
'Hoy! You there! You Kingly Red Lion guy!
That's it! I've repaid my debt! I'm done!
You take care of the rest!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
`Hoy, small fry!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yeah, yeah, I've heard. I take it you want a
chart and information about this island?


Then start by opening up your Sea Chart!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
And that's all the info I've got to offer!



If you want to hear it again, you'll have
to throw some more bait on the water for
me! Sorry, but that's my policy, fry!

I can't go fighting evil on an empty
stomach, you know!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
And with that...I'm off!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Aww! Gimme a break! What's with using the
same bait all the time? Don't they make a
premium brand of this stuff?

Oh, well. Such is the life of a fish. So...
You want to hear the info about this here
island again?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
And that's all the info I've got for you, fry!



You'd better be thankful for the clues you
got from me! I'm serious!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
And with that...I'm off!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hey... Have you ever seen what I call the
frightening fish-men?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Check this out... The other day I was out
at sea on a cruise, and without thinking
much about it, I tossed some leftover
bait out on the waves...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
And you will NEVER guess what happened!



This fishy-looking thing popped up on the
surface, but it was no ordinary fish! It had
this weird, human-looking smile on its face,
and it just gobbled up the bait!

The ocean is so very vast. Many mysterious
things that we've yet to even dream of lie
sleeping beneath its waves...

You'd better remember this! Even if you see
a shadow underwater that you THINK looks
like a fish, whatever you do, don't throw
bait out for it, OK?
Because if you do, one of the dreaded
fish-men might appear and pull you
underwater with him!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So, I'm feelin' pretty good. Why? 'Cause I
recently got myself a pet pig. Three, in fact!
I got a black-splotched pig, too! How often
do you see one of those? Not often, chum.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I've let 'em ashore to graze over yonder.
...But the thing is, I can't stop worryin'
about the little guys!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hey! What are you doin', lollygaggin'
around! There's only [?] left!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
See, if I don't get 'em out and exercise 'em
once in a while, they pick up excess flab!
Nobody likes an extra-fat pig, chum!

...So I'll be countin' on you to handle
this tomorrow, too!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hey, just so you know, if you ever have
money issues, I give good financial advice.
You come talk to me anytime, chum! I may
not look rich, but I've got plenty of cash!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh... You got that look about you...that look
that says you've run into some tight money
troubles... Am I right, chum?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You got any interest in takin' care of my
pigs for me? I'll pay cash, chum!
Definitely
I'm not that desperate
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You want to baby-sit my pigs again?
Definitely
I'm not that desperate
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...You aren't a very likable kid, are you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Really?! Then let me explain...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I've let three pigs loose on this island, but
now I'm a little worried about one of 'em.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Is he hungry? Has he gotten sick? Is he
lonely? Angry? Depressed? I can't help
worryin' about him, so I want you to find
the little guy and bring him back to me.
If you can do it in under [?],
I'll give you some pocket change!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
As for how you tell this guy apart from
the others... Well, it's easy, chum!
He's the pig that angers easily.

That pig's precious to me! Bring him back
here without injuring him and press [R] to
set him down beside me, all right?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
As for how you tell this guy apart from
the others... Well, it's simple, chum!
He's the stinky pig.

That pig's precious to me! Bring him back
here without injuring him and press [R] to
set him down beside me. All right?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
As for how you tell this guy apart from
the others... Well, it's real easy, chum!
He's the slightly stupid pig.

That pig's precious to me! Bring him back
here without injuring him and press [R] to
set him down beside me. All right?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Are you ready, chum?
Absolutely
I'm not sure...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Then let me explain it to you once more...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
All right! Startin' now, you have to do it
within [?]! Ready...?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
GO!!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What's that, chum?!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh! Did you go and bring me another
Skull Necklace?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh! Chum! That's a Skull Necklace!



I collect these things! ...But how'd you
know that?!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I can sell these for huge profits at antique
stores. Which reminds me, there's somethin'
I want to talk to you about, chum...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Could you give me three of these? If you
do, I'll let you play a really fun game.
I'll give you three
Good-bye
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...I can't stand you, chum...p!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hey, now! You don't have enough of 'em!
Don't rile me up like that, chum!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Thanks, chum! I'm happy to take 'em off
your hands!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
All right, then! Now I'll let you play my
little game. It's called...Piggy-Sitting!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I've let three pigs loose on this island.
You have to bring 'em all back to
me within [?]!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If you do a good job, I'll pay you for your
trouble! Are you ready, chum?
Absolutely
I'm not sure...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
All right! Bring 'em all to me within
[?]_startin' now!
Ready...?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh... Too bad! Time's up! If you can't beat
my pigs, I guess you're still a little green,
chum! But don't sweat it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hey! Why didn't you show up yesterday???
I was waitin' all day for you, chum!
Oh, well... I guess that's all water under
the ship's bridge...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Way to go, chum! I don't know how you
figured out how to catch 'em all_this guy
in particular!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oinky, oinky! Looks like you're full of
energy! I guess I didn't need to worry
after all. Well, thanks for playin', chum!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, yeah! I guess a promise is a promise...
I owe you a little pocket change, don't I?
All right, hold out your hand, chum!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I'm sure it was a good work-out for my pig,
too. Thanks again, chum!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Well, whatever. I guess I can let you
make one mistake. But hurry up! You only
have [?] left!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Boooo! Wrong!
...I said I'd let you make one mistake, right?
ONE!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I guess you can't beat my pigs at their
own game! ...You're still a little green,
chum! But don't sweat it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Wow! You found the third one! Nice work!
Well, chum...
You win.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But still... Cripes! How could my little
piggies lose like that...? They must be out
of shape_time for an exercise regimen!
Things won't go so easy for you next time!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh-ho! The first one arrives!
...You got [?] left, chum!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The second one shows up! Well, chum,
there's only [?] left!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Have you by chance seen...any
Skull Necklaces?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
My son is a sailor, but lately he's been
obsessed with collecting Skull Necklaces.
He never pays attention to his dear mum
anymore! He just goes on about necklaces!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You did it! Nice work! Perhaps next time
you can take me out to the cafe for a
drink afterwards!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Why, that was so easy! You see, this is
how one wins with dignity!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Aww... This bug in my belly just won't
settle down... I'm going straight home to
drown my sorrows in food!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You little darling...
Could I adopt you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
That's the only way the auction could end!
I'm a fierce competitor at everything I do!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I suppose there's no beating time...
I think I got a few more wrinkles tonight!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Young man, you shouldn't be so loose with
your wallet. I mean, you must have gone
through a lot of blood, sweat, and tears to
earn that kind of cash!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Well, I suppose good things DO come to
those who wait! Imagine that!
...Maybe I have more talent for this
sort of thing than I thought!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What's with that person!? Why, I've never
seen a pair of eyes change color like that
at the mere mention of the word "auction"!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Wow! I'm impressed! It looks like the
old gal doesn't win this time...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I did it! I tell you, I know how to use
my experience to make the most of any
situation! They did once call me "Miss
Auction," I'll have you know!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, well... But next time, I'll come bidding
like a racehorse right out of the gates!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
(Hoo hoo hoo! Poor kid doesn't get it!)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
(Oh, how cute! He thinks he's going to win!)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
(Ach! What? No... My, he's got spunk for
 such a youngster!)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Uh-oh! Wrong piggy, chum! The one you're

Uh-oh! Wrong piggy, chum! The one you're

Ahhhh! Nothin' better than a cup of
refreshment at your local cafe after a long
day's work... Absolutely NOTHIN'!

I'm tellin' you, those pirates were just
lookin' for a little relaxation. You don't
find cafes on the high seas!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Hey! You ain't got enough Rupees!



Look, in this game, you win as many Rupees
as you're able to find. It's just that easy.
If you wanna make your dreams come true,
go save up some cash.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
All righty! Then go down to the start line.

All righty then, here's the [?]

They're all yours. Enjoy, kiddo!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Looks like you made a fortune! Come back

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

What are you doin'? You gotta cross the

Otherwise I can't give you any Rupees!
C'mon, kiddo, use your brain!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
And don't you know it's a foul to cross the

Me, I just like to sit and gaze at the night

If you have anything that's good for looking
at the night sky, have a look at that moon.
I highly recommend it.

He was my buddy! I just can't take it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But...it's all a done deal now, so...
sorry if you got wrapped up in it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hmph! Nobody understands how I feel.

...Do me a favor? Beat it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What a jerk! How did he manage that?!
Right under my nose!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But I guess he IS an all-right guy...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You pesky little brat! Nobody understands
how I feel! Do you hear me? Nobody!
Not you! Not anybody!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Wait...



Are you trying to tell me that you DO
understand how I feel?
Completely
I couldn't care less
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Jerk!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...Oh, really? Then how about a little test
to see if you really do!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I want you to show me a picture of the
first perfectly round, pale thing you can
think of.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If you show me something that's exactly the
same as my favorite thing, then you win,
and I'll acknowledge...that you understand
the inner workings of my heart and mind.
It's quite a simple little riddle, isn't it?
Quickly, now! Bring it to me!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Wow! I feel totally rejuvenated, and its all
because of you!
...Thanks a lot!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What in the...?
Why are you so proud of this terrible
picture? Am I supposed to be impressed?

Let me tell you, if you don't show me a
zoomed-in pictograph of my favorite thing,
I can't be certain you know how I feel!
And then I'll consider you a liar!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, too bad...
The point of focus isn't exactly bad...
but it's not quite right, either.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...What's round about this? Nothing!
I said something perfectly round and pale!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What's pale about this? Nothing!
I said something perfectly round and pale!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oooooh! That's right! That certainly is the
pictograph I'm looking for! The correct
answer is exactly what you've shown me:
the full moon!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Unrequited love may have twisted me up
inside, but I can still find peace when I
gaze at the timeless moon...

And of all her phases, I particularly love
gazing at the full moon!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I know I caused you a lot of trouble,
but...thanks!


I really mean it! I want you to have this for
all your efforts. Just a little reward for
easing the pain of this troubled heart.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
This supposedly has a spot on it that
marks where some sunken treasure lies.


I don't have a boat, so I can't leave this
island to go look for it anyway.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Tonight I'll be asking the night sky to help
you find the treasure! Best of luck!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yes! Tonight is a full moon!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Awww... I wanted to see Linda, not you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Heh heh! It's another fine moon tonight.
Say, did you know...?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Like the human heart, the shape of the
moon changes with time. Every night,
it becomes just a little bit different.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Look at that! Aren't the three sister-stars
impressive? What a stellar family!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Heh heh heh heh! Do you know what the
name of that constellation is?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Here is your letter.

Ya!!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Mighty fine boat you got there, bub.
You must be searching for treasure on the
sea floor, too. Aren't you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Har har harrrrr! You won't get any from us,
bub! Not likely!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Lemme ask you something real quick:
who wanders around on a fishless sea?


I'll tell you who, bub: Only pirates,
monsters, and treasure-hunters like
ourselves! And maybe some other things
that I've never heard of...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Y'know, with all the weak island-dwellers
who never leave their shores, I'm amazed to
see such a tiny little guy out here.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I like your style, bub! I feel like I've known
you my whole life!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So hey, bub, tell you what! As one treasure-
hunter to another, I'll give you this...
You'll definitely be needing it if you want
to haul up treasure.
Come on! Take it! I won't take "no" for an
answer. I also won't take "nay," "nope,"
or "nar." Just grab it!

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
First, press [D-pad][v] to open your Sea Chart,
then press [Y] to check your special charts.


You search for treasure by comparing the
specific Island Charts on the left with the
Treasure Charts on the right. Simple, bub!

After that, all you need to do is use the
same thing we use to haul up treasure: one
of those Grappling Hooks that the Rito
tribesfolk of Dragon Roost Island use.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
All right, little treasure-buddy!
Best of luck to all of us!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

First, press [D-pad][v] to open your Sea Chart,

You search for treasure by comparing the
specific Island Charts on the left with the
Treasure Charts on the right.

Then, you just use your Grappling Hook
while in your boat to haul up treasure!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Well, little treasure-buddy, good luck to all
of us! Happy hunting!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What's the matter, bub?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If you want to search for treasure, you
should open your Sea Chart and press [Y]
to check your Island Charts.

You can compare the Island Charts on the
left with the Treasure Charts on the right.
It's not rocket science, bub!

Besides Treasure Charts, you'll also need
a Grappling Hook that you can use to haul
up treasure.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
That's all there is to it, bub!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

To search for treasure, you should open
your Sea Chart and press [Y] to check

It's not quantum physics, bub!

The secret to hauling up treasure is to
go toward the area marked on the map, and
once you think you've found the right spot...

Use your Grappling Hook while in your boat!
Trust me, it'll work, bub!


The only other thing you need is patience!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So that's how it works!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...Bub...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
To haul up treasure, you need both a
Treasure Chart and a Grappling Hook.


You do get it, don't you, bub?
I mean, it's not brain surgery.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Then quit bugging me!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
To get treasure, you have to check
your Treasure Charts carefully and then
use your Grappling Hook to haul it up.

You do get that, don't you, bub?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Then quit bugging me!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ya!!! Bub!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You collecting treasure, bub?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
To see where you can find treasure, open
your Sea Chart and press [Y] to check
your special charts.

If you compare the Island Charts on the left
with the Treasure Charts on the right, it
should be easy to figure out!

The secret to hauling up treasure is to go
to the spot marked on the map and then
use your Grappling Hook while in your boat.
Then it just takes patience, bub!
A lot of first-time treasure-hunters give
up pretty quickly because they don't get
how it works, but they're missing out!
It's really not that hard!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So that's how it works!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...Bub...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...I don't know how many times I have to
explain it to you, but here goes...


If you want to search for treasure, first
open your Sea Chart, then press [Y] to
check your special charts.

Compare the Island Charts on the left with
the Treasure Charts on the right. Then
you can figure out where the treasure is!

You'll have to use both your Treasure
Charts and your Grappling Hook to haul
up the treasure.

You got that, bub? And do you understand
what we're doing now? Good!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So, you understand what treasure-hunting
is all about now, right, bub?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
YAA!!! BUB!!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You find yourself a Grappling Hook, bub?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
For hauling up treasure, there's nothing
better than the Grappling Hooks used by
the Rito tribe on Dragon Roost Island!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You'd better see what you can do to
get yourself one, bub!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...Bub...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You do know that you need a Grappling
Hook to haul up treasure, right?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
And you do know what it is that we 
treasure-hunters do, right, bub...?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ya! Bub!!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You collecting treasure, bub?



I know you're probably sick of hearing this,
but first you should open your Sea Chart
and press [Y] to check your special charts.

Then just compare the Island Charts on the
left with the Treasure Charts on the right
to see where the treasure is hidden!
Isn't that great, bub?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I'll give you all the Rupees we've found.
We're actually searching for other
treasure...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Keep it quiet, but our actual goal is to
find the legendary treasure that sleeps at
the bottom of the sea!

If you must know, bub, it's these golden,
triangular-shaped...


Triumph Forks!!! Yeah! Some sort of magical
cutlery! That's what we heard!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...But don't tell anybody, bub!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
BUB!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If you know anything about the legendary
golden treasure...


Those Triumph Forks thingies...
Be sure to tell me.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, and keep this a well-guarded
secret, bub...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name]...
As was the case with Medli, I have no
doubt that Makar, too, has some special
role to play in these events.
Discovering that role is your duty.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I am certain that by cooperating, the two
of you can overcome the dangers and
pitfalls of this temple...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...I see. So...the Forsaken Fortress
has already...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ahh, like a molting snake that casts off
its dead skin!


That place is so empty and quiet...
one can almost hear the echo of dead
leaves falling to the cold, cracked ground!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
..........
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Why? What ails you? What?
Lose the long face!


The monsters are gone from the world!
Doesn't that make you a little happy?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name], I have troubling news...



Ganon has not shown himself above the
seas since Valoo unleashed his fiery wrath
upon him.

And what's worse, there is not a creature
stirring in his base of operations in this
world...the Forsaken Fortress.

...I cannot imagine how it is possible,
and yet I cannot shake this foreboding
feeling I have about the princess, Zelda.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name], you must search for all the
Triforce shards so that we can head back
to Hyrule without delay!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name]! You must sail to the
Tower of the Gods immediately!


We must go down to Hyrule with the
completed Triforce!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What are you doing?



Is the place you should be seeking not
marked on your sea chart?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What are you doing? Make haste! You must
go to the place marked on your sea chart!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name]... I sense that terrible things
are happening...


Quickly! We must hurry on to the place
marked on your sea chart!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What are you doing?!



We must get to Windfall quickly and see
what we can learn of the pirates' motives.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What is the matter, [player_name]?
It is time for you to return to your
homeland. We must sail to Outset Island.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
We cannot get inside the cave unless you
can destroy the stone slab that blocks its
entrance...and you must do it before we are
sucked into the whirlpool!
I suppose the only way to destroy a stone
slab that large is to break it into pieces,
starting at the top. Take care not to waste
your bombs.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You must set one pearl in each of the
locations marked on your sea chart.
At that time, the place where your courage
will be tested shall become clear to us.
Come! We must press on, undeterred by the
rising tide of Ganon's evil designs!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Beyond this place, you must do battle with
the power of the gods...but even as you do
so, you must also borrow that power!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What are you doing?!



Quickly! You must rise up and meet the
challenge of the Tower of the Gods.
It is the only way you can get the strength
you need to save your sister!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The power you must obtain lies ahead,
hidden within the castle.


Go. Enter the castle. Do not get lost!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
At long last, our preparations are complete.
You must return to me so that we can return
by the same path that brought us here.

The time has come to save your sister from
her prison in the Forsaken Fortress!
Hurry, [player_name]!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Why do you delay? We must head for the
Forsaken Fortress to save your sister!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Your sister is being held at the top of the
central tower! ...I hope you have not
forgotten how to get there!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The temples where the sages await cannot
be entered easily.


It is at times such as this when one would
be wise to gather information from those
who live in the seas nearby.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So, Ganon's reach has extended to the very
sages themselves...


The hint that will help us find the new sage
can be found in the shape of the instrument
on the rock door.

Does it not look familiar to you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What is the matter? Quickly! Guide this one
to the temple so the Master Sword can
regain its power!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Why do you tarry? Power has not fully
returned to the Master Sword...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The Master Sword's power still has not
fully returned. Perhaps I am mistaken,
but I fear the worst for the sage in
the remaining temple.
You must hurry, [player_name]!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You must guide a new sage to the remaining
temple if the Master Sword is to regain all
of its power!

If we are ever to ease poor Fado's regret,
we must seek out the new sage!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Why do you delay? You must guide this
one to the temple if the power to repel
evil is to be returned to the Master Sword!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What distracts you? The Master Sword still
has not recovered the power to repel evil...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
We cannot return to Hyrule without first
re-forming a piece of the Triforce.


It is now our duty to gather the
eight Triforce shards!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The Triforce you possess is complete.
We must make for the Tower of the Gods
and return to Hyrule.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What are you doing? The path to Hyrule
has already been opened! We must return
to where Princess Zelda waits!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I am concerned about Princess Zelda...
Quickly! Go into the castle and confirm
her safety!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So, despite our efforts, the princess has
fallen into Ganon's hands...

Yet all is not lost...
Beyond the bridge on the far side of the
castle stands Ganon's Tower. I am certain
Zelda is being held there.

Now that the Master Sword is once again
blessed with the power to repel evil,
you should be able to break through
Ganon's Barrier and enter the tower!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Long ago, Ganon's Tower was an
impenetrable fortress that not even
the daring and dauntless Knights of
Hyrule could hope to assail.
You must sharpen your senses so as not to
fall victim to Ganon's illusions.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If you wish to return to the world above,
then climb aboard and enter the light!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The world above is still calm and peaceful.
...But the future is bleak. If Ganon is able
to absorb Zelda's powers...

[player_name], we must return to Ganon's
Tower as soon as your errands are
complete. You must rescue Zelda from
Ganon's clutches at all costs!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ganon has likely been made aware of our
little incursion already...


...But you have the Master Sword!



That sword shall shine in the darkness,
casting back evil... With it in your hands,
none can keep you from rescuing your
sister!
Do not be afraid!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I see... So this is the portal through which
Ganon was able to seep into the
unsuspecting world above...

[player_name], we shall make use of this
path that Ganon created for himself.


If there is anything from the world above
that you believe you need, then climb into
the boat and enter the column of darkness!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Do you sleep still?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Wait!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Do not be so hasty, boy...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I can see this girl's dreams...



Oceans...
Oceans...


Oceans...
Oceans...


Oceans as far as the eye can see.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
They are vast seas...
None can swim across them...
They yield no fish to catch...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What did the King of Hyrule say?
...That the gods sealed Hyrule away?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
And they left behind people who would
one day awaken Hyrule?!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
How ridiculous...



So many pathetic creatures, scattered
across a handful of islands, drifting on this
sea like fallen leaves on a forgotten pool...
What can they possibly hope to achieve?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Don't you see?
All of you...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Your gods destroyed you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I have been waiting for you, boy.



For one like you...
Yes... For the hero.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Do not betray my expectations.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yes, surely you are the Hero of Time,
reborn...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Your time has come...



Come now... Stand before me!

My country lay within a vast desert.

________________________________________
When the sun rose into the sky, a burning
wind punished my lands, searing the world.
And when the moon climbed into the dark
of night, a frigid gale pierced our homes.
No matter when it came, the wind carried
the same thing... Death.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But the winds that blew across the green
fields of Hyrule brought something other
than suffering and ruin.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I coveted that wind, I suppose.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It can only be called fate.



...That here, I would again gather the
three with the crests.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...That I should lay my hand on that which
grants the wishes of the beholder...


That when power, wisdom, and courage
come together, the gods would have no
choice but to come down...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The power of the gods... The Triforce!
He who touches it will have whatever he
desires granted!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Already, the crest of wisdom is mine...

All that remains...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Do not fear. I will not kill you...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I merely have need of the power that dwells
within you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Now! Let us put an end to that which
binds us together!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Gods! Hear that which I desire!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Expose this land to the rays of the sun
once more! Let them burn forth!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Give Hyrule to me!!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
He who touches it will have whatever he
desires granted...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

That is what you said, is it not, Ganondorf?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Gods of the Triforce!
Hear that which I desire!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hope! I desire hope for
these children!

Give them a future!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Wash away this ancient
land of Hyrule!

Let a ray of hope shine
on the future of the world!!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
And let our destinies finally be fulfilled...



Ganondorf! May you drown with Hyrule!!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
This is foolishness...
A future...for you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What are you laughing at, Ganondorf?!
You're insane!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name]! I'm sorry!
I overslept!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I think it's time for us to say good-bye to
this place.


We must return to the world above!
Back to our ocean!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Very well, then...
Allow me to show you...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Your future...



Yes... Allow me to show you...



Just what hope you have...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
My children... Listen to me.



I have lived regretting the past.
And I have faced those regrets.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If only I could do things over again...
Not a day of my life has gone by without
my thoughts turning to my kingdom of old.

I have lived bound to Hyrule.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
In that sense, I was the same as Ganondorf.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But you...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I want you to live for the future.



There may be nothing left for you...



But despite that, you must look forward
and walk a path of hope, trusting that it
will sustain you when darkness comes.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Farewell...



This is the only world that your ancestors
were able to leave you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Please...forgive us.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
W-Wait!



You could... You could come with us!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yes, of course... We have a ship!
We can find it.
We WILL find it!

The land that will be the next Hyrule!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...



Ah, but child... That land will not
be Hyrule.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It will be YOUR land!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

The platform ahead is hung in perfect

it will dump you into the lava.

There must be a way to cut the cords

________________________________________
Why are you just wandering around?
A chest appeared beneath the suspension
bridge. Did you not see it?

You must find a way to get to the floor
below without plunging into the lava.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
A mighty enemy stands before you!
Even in the face of such danger, however,
you would be wise to change your

It is important to get a firm grasp of
your surroundings and see what you can use
to swing the battle in your favor...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Oh! Too bad! You flew out of bounds!
That disqualifies you!

They do that sometimes.

________________________________________
...Ohhh, that's just atrocious flying!
Soaring out of bounds disqualifies you!
You must concentrate! Can't you at least
aim for your goal?

Why, this town is full of faces that don't

of a ship. Are we sailors the only ones?
Has no one else set out on the Great Sea?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Hmmm... It's a westerly wind that's blowing
now. If you were to sail where this wind
would take you, you'd end up on a straight
shot for Dragon Roost Island...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...But I suppose telling that to a non-sailor
like yourself is a bit pointless, eh?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

You say you want a sail for a boat?
Tell me you're kidding with me!
...Listen up, laddie! Try using your

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yeah! We would never tell you about that
strange guy dressed from head to toe in
green who's locked up in the town jail!
...But I wonder if he's related to you...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yeah! We would never tell you about the
merchants with the huge backpacks who
are on Bomb Island, Greatfish Isle, and

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Yeah! We'd never tell you that our teacher,

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Oh, you're the fledgling the chieftain
mentioned, aren't you?


I feel as though I should tell you, despite
what he may seem like right now, young
master Komali is quite a pleasant child...

His father, the chieftain, is quite busy, but
Komali's never once complained, though I'm
sure he's been lonely at times. He's the
chieftain's son through and through.
However, his grandmother passed recently,
and Komali seems lost. His confidence is...
gone. His grandmother was always with
him, you see. A great, great woman...
That sparkling ball that the young master
keeps with him was actually a gift from the
great Valoo to Komali's grandmother.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
When you meet young master Komali, ask
him about the ball he's carrying.


That might just help break the ice.



It's a shame that I'm too busy to spend
more time with you. You seem to be a nice
enough fellow. Sorry.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Young master Komali went running back to
his chambers. He seemed very excited.


It's been a while since we've seen him
so energized...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The great Valoo has reverted to his
normal disposition?


Perhaps this will return things to normalcy.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ah, it's a pleasure to see you again.



I thought things would be easier once the
problems with the great Valoo were solved,
but now I find we're busy trying to catch up
on regular business issues.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I can't be much in the way of company, but
I hope you can stay and rest a while...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
How nice to see you again.



There are no deliveries at night, but...
There's so much inside that needs to be
cleaned up and organized!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I can't be much in the way of company, but
it's dangerous outside, so why don't you sit
and stay a while?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...Don't try to play tricks on us!
You don't have that many Rupees!

Sturgeon's One-Point Lessons
Lesson One

The Energy of Life
To be young is to know no limits to
one's stamina. To become stronger, one
must first know oneself.

The [?][?][?] in the upper-left shows one's
current life energy. Perhaps a fancier way
to describe it would be to call it a life
gauge.
As one experiences trials and hardships in
life, one will naturally gain more [?]s.


However, if one is injured and takes
damage, those [?]s will decrease. At such
times it may be possible to replenish one's
health by cutting grass and finding hearts.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Sturgeon's One-Point Lessons
Lesson Two

Do Not Underestimate the Sea
It's easy to get swept up by a little success
at swimming, but the sea can be fickle!
Swimming for too long will drain one's
energy, and eventually one will sink.
Watch the round icon in the bottom-right
while in the water. This is one's swim timer.


One should be sure to get back to shore
before one's swim timer runs out. If one
doesn't, I can't be responsible for what
happens next.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Sturgeon's One-Point Lessons
Lesson Three

The Great Map of Life
As one is often hasty and acts without
thinking when young, it's easy to get
lost on one's way.

It is at confused times such as this that
one must refer to his or her Area Map in
the lower-left.

The yellow arrow shows one's current
location. Enlarge the map with [D-pad][>], or hide
the map with [D-pad][<].

The [v] in the top-right portion of the
Area Map indicates wind direction. Always
remember that the wind blows in the
direction of the arrow. Always!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Sturgeon's One-Point Lessons
Lesson Four

Material Goods
The more things one tries to experience
in life, the more experience-related
belongings one tends to gather.

And, of course, with those belongings
comes a need to keep track of them and
keep them in good order.

One needs only to press START/PAUSE to
see the items he or she has obtained.


The Items screen contains items the
player can set to and use with
[Y], [Z], and [X].

The Quest Status screen, for its part,
contains vital items related to one's quest.


It's possible to switch between these two
screens by pressing [L] or [R].
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Sturgeon's One-Point Lessons
Lesson Five


How Not to Regret the Things One Fails to
Do in Life. A VERY IMPORTANT LESSON!


There are many things one longs to do in
the limited time one has in this world.
The easiest way not to regret things one
wanted, but failed, to do is to save.
While one may feel invincible and wish to
continue one's quest, one never knows when
disaster or calamity may strike.

If one's life energy is extinguished before
one has had a chance to save, then one's
life will have been lived in vain.

It is a shame to regret the deeds one has
failed to accomplish in life. Press
START/PAUSE and choose Save on either
the Items screen or the Quest Status screen.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Sturgeon's One-Point Lessons
Lesson Six

Improving Human Relations
To improve one's relations with one's
fellow beings, one must be outgoing and
press [A] to speak to all people one meets.

When one opens one's heart to others,
others will open their hearts in return
and offer wisdom on many important things.

If the person's advice is strange or cannot
be understood, one should not feel shy.
One should simply ask the person to repeat
the statement by pressing [A] again.
More often than not, if one asks politely,
a person will say the same thing over and
over again until the meaning is clear.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Sturgeon's One-Point Lessons
Lesson Seven

Knowing One's Own Abilities
To improve one's life, it is wise to watch
[A] and [R] calmly whenever one comes
across a person or an object.

By doing so, [A] and [R] will pass along
wisdom regarding how one can best interact
with that person or object. To know one's
own abilities is to know one's limits.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Sturgeon's One-Point Lessons
Lesson Eight

Changing Perspective Leads to Success
The young often assume that they can see
all that is before them, but oftentimes they
are missing out on a grander view.

By using [C] to change perspective, one
can often find oneself gazing upon sights
and discoveries one never expected to see.

Once one has seen all there is to see
around oneself and determined an
appropriate course of action, it is wise
then to press [L] and take action.
To get things at eye level, one should stop
in one's tracks, press [L], and tilt [C] [v].
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Sturgeon's One-Point Lessons
Lesson Nine

A Fool and His Rupees Are Soon Parted
It is commonly known that he who makes
poor use of Rupees will have a hard life.


In order to fully enjoy a long life, it is
wise to gather Rupees early and often.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

fairy fountain. The legendary hero was said
to come here after battle so the fairies
could ease his weariness.
It was also said that whoever met with the
Great Fairy who lived here was blessed
with great fortune, so it came to be known
as the Fountain of the Fortune Goddess.

Heyyyyyy! What do you think you're doing?
I can't measure that, you strange person!
...Why, you don't even know which direction
you're supposed to fly, do you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...You can't do that! Can't you see the
banner over there by your goal?! Why are
you flying in the OPPOSITE direction?!?
That's makes very little sense!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

  How are you doing, [player_name]? Do
  you have enough of Granny's soup?
  Where are you now?

  You may be closer than I suspect!



  Are you hungry? Are you keeping warm?
  You haven't injured yourself, have you?


  You always work so hard, [player_name].
  Do you have enough Rupees? 
  Your grandma doesn't have a lot, but I'm
  sending you everything I've saved up.
  As long as I have you and Aryll, I don't
  need anything else.


  I just want the two of you to return
  home safely.
                                 Love, Grandma

Y-You're incredible! D-Did you just...
FLY down here?!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
That's the coolest thing ever! Hey! If you
can fly, do you think maybe you can hit
that switch over there? Huh? Can you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Huh? You can't see it? It's just over there,
up toward the top of the Forest Haven...


Don't you have a Telescope? I mean, who
doesn't in this day and age?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You have to hit that switch up there if you
want to get down into the Nintendo Gallery
nestled beneath this island.

If you had a Telescope you could probably
see what I'm talking about.
...That switch is a real pain!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
See, once you become a gallery member,
they teach you how to activate the switch,
but I'm not a member yet...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Dang! If I could only fly through the skies...
Whee! Like a seagull! That would be great...

The switch is way up on top of that island,
at the base of that one branch... You see
what I mean? Right in that little nook...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hey! Ooh! Hey! Wow!
What kind of figurine are you after?


If you have a Picto Box, you can get as
many figurines as you like! Yeah! Wow!
...This place is like paradise!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So...you were a member this whole time!
Awesome! Hey, and thanks to you, I got in
and became a member, too!

Check it out! I gave this guy a pictograph,
and he gave me this figurine in return!
Talk about cool! This'll be all the rage!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You should get some figurines made, too!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Welcome, [player_name].
The figurine you requested is ready.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It's been a long time since I've done
work this exceptional. [?]
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I know I always say this, but this is some
of the best work I've done in quite a while.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Go in that door there to check it out.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What's the matter? Hurry up and go look
at it. You won't be disappointed.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Well? Do you like it? If you do, then go
find me another great subject to work on!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Do you have a new subject for me?
If you do, please show it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, no, [player_name]! The figurine-making
process is a trade secret, I'm afraid. I can't
let you take any pictographs of my work.
Could you come back tomorrow?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...What's this? This is in black and white!
Monochrome pictographs just don't provide
the kind of inspiration I need to create a
beautiful figurine, I'm afraid.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hmmm... Yes... This is a fine pictograph, but
it just isn't the type of thing that inspires
me. No, not even in the least bit.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I'll buy up to [?] of them.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Wait just a second... I've already made a
figurine of this. Haven't you seen it yet?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Faces are the very soul of all figurines!
If you don't give me a shot where the
subject is completely facing the Picto Box,
I'm afraid I can't craft a figurine for you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh! Well, this is almost right...
If you only had taken a shot that showed
the subject's entire body, I'd be quite
inspired to craft a figurine of this.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ahh... Hah... Mmmm...
This is quite an inspiring motif!


Hurrah! I'm filled with inspiration!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So what's your name, kid?
...[player_name]?
[player_name], is it?

Well, [player_name], this officially marks
your induction into our little club. [?]


I think I should be done with this tomorrow.
If you'd like, you can go ahead and take a
look at our gallery in the meantime.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
All righty! As usual, you'll have to wait
until tomorrow. I bet you're looking forward
to seeing what you're going to get!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Welcome!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Welcome to the Nintendo Gallery
Figurine Palace! [?]
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
This is your first time here, isn't it?
Did one of our members provide you with
an introduction, I hope?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ah, well, no worries one way or the other.
We've been losing members due to our lack
of "gimmicky attractions"...but we don't
worry. True fans know we're the coolest.
So anyway, do you know what it takes to
become a member of our club?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The figurines we have on display here have
all been made using pictographs provided
by our devoted members.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If you bring me, the master sculptor, a
pictograph that steals my breath away...


Then you'll become a member, and you'll
become able to view the collection in our
galleries. And won't that be nice?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Do you have such a pictograph?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Would you like to be a member? Oh?
In that case, bring me a pictograph
that steals my breath away.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
As far as what kind of pictograph has the
power to steal my breath away...


Well, it can be either a person or a monster.
You just have to be careful to take a
full-body shot with your subject facing you.[?]
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...But until you bring me a subject that I
like, you can't join. Sorry, but that's
the way the cookie crumbles!

I AM making these figurines for free, so I
figure I should be allowed this one little
rule, don't you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Welcome, [player_name].
Did you find me a new subject?
Well, show it to me! [?]
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
How do you like my figurine? Isn't it
marvelous? We do use only the highest
quality material, after all, so I suppose
it couldn't be anything less than lovely.
You can make figurines out of many
different materials, but I carve mine from
rainbow stone_it's a special type of rock
whose colors defy description.
Rainbow stone is a very precious material,
and it can only be found around here!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, hey! Sorry, but only members are
allowed to view our gallery!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Come on! Get out of our way!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

You're a pain!

Sturgeon's One-Point Lessons
Lesson Ten

Becoming the Champion of Life!
Learn all there is to learn in
lessons one through nine...


And no matter what happens...
Do not give up, do not complain,
and do NOT stay up all night playing!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

I am certain that the Princess Zelda is

Hurry to her, [player_name]!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ah. Have you come for some serious
instruction in the way of the sword?
Yes, sir
No, sir
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
A sword can do good or evil. It reflects
the heart of the one who uses it.
...But you cannot have one until you
learn the basics, I am afraid!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Good! That is enough!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It is as I foresaw! One day, you shall
become a master of the sword! But it is
still too soon to give you a sword to
carry around with you.
I'm afraid I cannot give you one yet.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If I did give you one, I am certain
your grandmother would be quite upset with
me...and I do not need that!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But...if for any reason you feel you need
more training, then come see me again.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Very good! That is enough!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
But...it is still too soon for me to give
you a sword to carry around with you.


You must come practice more, young one!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
And yet...I sense a certain anxiousness
in the sword you hold...an eagerness that
goes far beyond the mere desire to be
wielded on the fields of battle...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I do not know what has happened...



But I have faith in you. Somehow, I doubt
you will misuse that sword...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You may have it, [player_name]. I give it
freely. Take the blade with you...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Since the olden days, this sword has been
used to fend off evil...


Its blade is infused with the desire to
become strong and righteous.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Be strong, [player_name].
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name]! Heed my words! Do not
neglect your daily training!


Press [A] while running to practice a rolling
attack. Tilt [+] [<] or [>] and press [A] while
[L]-targeting to practice jumping.

Ah, yes. And remember, you can press [A]
while tilting [+] [^] to do back-flips.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Please remember!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name]! Where are you going!?
We have not finished our practice!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Now, [player_name]! Run quickly and press
[A] to perform a rolling attack!
Hit the wall as hard as you can!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What's that? The Knight's Crest?



Does that intrigue you, young one?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It is still too early to discuss such
things with you...


But if you happen across ten of those,
show them to me! Then I can tell you
what they are and what they do. But...
I will only speak if you get ten of them.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What say you, [player_name]?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
That was some racket outside, wasn't it!



On another topic entirely, maybe it's just
my age, but lately...I've had quite a hard
time seeing things from a distance.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What's the matter, my lad? You look pale...
Is everything all right?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So soon? My, my, my...
If you're already old enough to be wearing
those clothes...

...Then it's going to be very important for
you to gather as much wisdom as you can
from now on! If you're to make your way in
the world, that is, [player_name]!
Now, I've been studying a wealth of topics
since long before you were born. I'm what
you'd call a brain-of-all-trades!

You're a smart little fellow yourself, aren't
you? I've been thinking it's time for me to
pass some of my wisdom down, and maybe
you're the one I should pass it down to...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
My stars! What was that racket outside?!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, [player_name]! You look cute as a bug
in that outfit!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Today is your birthday, isn't it,
[player_name]? Well, how nice for you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Umm... Your grandma was calling for you,
[player_name].


And so was my mom!

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So? So? What's for dinner at your house
tonight, [player_name]?


Can you come up the hill later and play?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Did you find anything you can use as a
shield? Anything at all? No?


You'd better hurry up and find one before
I change my mind!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Wow, that's a decrepit old shield...
Are you sure you can still use that thing?
Are you going to get splinters and cry?

Well, whatever...
If you're ready, then let's go!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Are you sure you're ready to do this?



Because we don't have time to play little
kiddie games with you! Got it? Good!
Then let's go!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Ho ho! So beautiful! Incredibly beautiful!



I'm so glad I bought this kaleidoscope! [?]

  How have you been, Big Brother?
  I'm here on the pirate ship writing you
  this letter. Isn't that neat?

  At first, I was really scared, but they're
  all actually nice...for pirates, I mean.


  Mr. Gonzo is a really big guy, but ever
  since Miss Tetra left, he's been crying
  like a baby. It's kinda funny...but sort
  of sad, too.
  Nudge is a little strange, but nice, too,
  and as for Senza...his beard makes him
  look pretty mean, but he tells really cool
  stories when he gets in the right mood.
  Zuko's kind of weird, and Mako is pretty
  quiet... Mako immediately gets mad
  whenever I try to take his glasses...so I
  do that a lot. Hee hee!
  As usual, Niko is always fooling around.
  He won't take anything serious. Actually,
  he seems sad not to have you around
  anymore. Were you guys good friends?
  I helped them all out with their chores,
  and they actually paid me a little for it,
  so I'm sending the money to you. Please
  use it, Big Brother!
  I'll loan you my telescope for a little
  longer...but you have to return it to me
  eventually, OK?

  I'm doing fine here, so don't you worry.
  I'll take care of myself, so you be sure to
  take good care of yourself. Good luck!
                                       Aryll

Yeah, he left one last figurine and took

Ah, Master! Do you have an interest in the
amusements of nobility?
I do, indeed
Not in the least
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Well, in that case, would you care to hear
an explanation of the game?
Indeed I would
No, thank you
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Bzzzt! Of course! Bzzzt!
Sorry to bother you with such trifling
things, Master! Awfully sorry!

Very good, Master. Please enjoy yourself.

money! Do remember that!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

...Don't you know? The hooded guy who
runs the little stall downstairs...
I think his name is Zunari...

Anyway, he's been hiding an incredible
treasure down there. That's what he says,
anyway. Something incredible.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The fact is, he comes up here all the time
just to brag about it.


To be honest, I'm pretty tired of hearing
about it, whatever it is.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Have you heard? About Zunari? You know,
that big-hooded man who runs the stall
just downstairs from here?

Well, I hear he had an incredible treasure
that he valued above all else in that safe
of his, but that he went and gave it to
some strange boy for no apparent reason!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
"My dear! I've gone and spread a little
joy to a pitiable boy! Dear me!"
...That's what he said, with the most
serious of looks on his face. 
It was a real eye-opener! I mean, what a
great person! I've completely changed my
opinion of him!

[player_name], what's going on?



We must hurry to reach the Earth Temple!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Well, [player_name]...



I'm not very confident, but I think I should
try to fly...


I'll fly where you tell me to... 
Just tap [A] to keep me airborne!


OK, whenever you're ready... Just use the
Wind Waker to guide me.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name], what are you doing?



Please take me to the Wind Temple.
Quickly!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name]...



I don't think I have the power to aid
you much, [player_name]...


But I can at least plant a tree here in this
soft soil...


If you conduct me, I can use [A] to
sow seeds.


Use your Wind Waker to conduct me.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name]! I'm over here!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The stone that blocks the entrance seems
extremely heavy.


The only way you could move it,
[player_name], is if you were to become
as heavy as the Great Deku Tree himself.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name]!



[player_name], I think that the Hookshot
you have can probably latch onto the
trees I planted. Give it a try!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name], I'm feeling a bit more
confident now.


I'm not sure how high I can fly while
carrying you, [player_name], but I'll
do the best that I can.

Just pick me up and jump, OK?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It seems like the instrument I'm carrying
can reflect light!


This can help, I think! Instruct me where to
reflect the light and use [A] to face my
instrument in that direction.

Use the Wind Waker to guide me, OK?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
[player_name]!!
I'm over here!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Well... I just thought of something.



If we use your shield and my instrument
together, I think we can reflect light onto
two different places at once.

Do you think that'd be useful?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Well, I'm not sure how to...explain this...



I think the light that I reflect off of my
instrument can be redirected using
your shield, [player_name]...

Do you think this could prove useful?



I hope you're not offended by my
suggestions. I just want to be helpful...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

[player_name], would you care for another
of my Legendary Pictographs?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Today I have prepared a pictograph of

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Guess what, young [player_name]! Today is
a great day in pictography!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Today marks the day long past when I,
as a young lad still struggling to reach
the pinnacle of pictography, received
my very first Legendary Pictograph.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
A Legendary Pictograph is an image of a
being or essence that has passed
beyond the knowledge of this world.
They're quite incredible, really.
These are images that one comes across
only in the rarest of circumstances, but as
I am the leading pictographer in the land,
I have managed to gather many of them.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
And yet, [player_name], seeing as how you
are one who has dedicated his life to the
art of pictography, as I have...

I am willing to pass on to you one of these
treasured Legendary Pictographs.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If you have any open pictograph slots,
I will place the image in your Deluxe Picto
Box. Let me see it for a moment, will you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
For me, every day is Pictography Day!
I cannot wait for tomorrow to come!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
...Hmmph! The box is full!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I shall place this pictograph in there
immediately! Er... Hmmm, now...
But perhaps that would be hasty...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
This is, after all, a very precious thing. I
cannot just give it away for free, can I?


What do you say, young sir? Will you pay
50 Rupees for it?
I'll pay
No way

This small gang of four calls itself the
Killer Bees. Starting from the left, the
members are:

The leader, Ivan:

 He's the Killer Bee's thug.

Dear me, but there's a terrible storm raging

I just saw some strangers here in town.
They went over toward the bomb shop.

It would seem that there won't be an

Not in a storm like this, there won't!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Is it true that pirates have invaded our
peaceful little island?


That's terrible news! What am I supposed to
do if they come to my coffee house and
start raising a ruckus?!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
It's true! One hundred percent true!
I've seen it myself! A stern-looking pirate
ship sailing full-speed toward this little
town! I'd swear on the sea!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Have you heard? There are pirates here on
this island now. RIGHT now! Well, that's
what they say, anyway.
...Me, I don't believe it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Now let's say_just for a moment_that
pirates actually did come ashore...
What would they want with a peaceful
village like this?! Tell me that, laddie!

How cool is that, man? They absolutely
LOVE you here! I hope they'll be saying that

...Hey, what's that?



Why, small fry! That's a fine-looking bow
you got there! Where'd you get that?


If you're not in any kind of hurry, why

OK
Sorry
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh! Fine! Great! Like I care! 
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hoo hoo! Of course you will, fry!
And to be honest, you'll be helping me out.
See, I've been having some ferocious body
aches that only acupuncture can cure!
Check it out: I'll give you 10 arrows for that
bow of yours, and I want you to aim those
suckers at me when I leap out of the sea!
Yeah! See if you can't peg me with 'em!
For each arrow you nail me with, I'll
give you 10 Rupees...and if you hit me
all 10 times, I'll give you 200 Rupees!

What? You worried about little old me, fry?



Hah! Don't be! I'm a man-fish! I've spent my
life being toughened up by seas rougher
than any you've ever seen! Those arrows of
yours ain't got nothing on me!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Get ready to start, small fry!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So anyway, can I interest you in that little
game of ours? I'm ready to play! Are you?
What do you say, small fry?

Do you want to play?
Sure
Not really
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
AHH![?] That hit the spot!
That completely cured my stiff neck!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
W-Way to go, small fry!
That was p-perfect!


I guess I owe you the 200 Rupees I promised
you. Well, take it, you thief!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What's the deal, fry?
You could only hit me [?] times?


Oh, well. What's a man-fish to do?
Well, here's your [?]! Go on! Take `em!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What's the deal, fry?! You could only
hit me once?! How's that supposed to cure
the pain in my neck? Get it together!

Ah, whatever! Take your 10 Rupees and go!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
What's the matter with you, fry?
With a fine bow like that you'd think you
could at least hit me once!

It looks like you need some time on rough
seas to toughen you up, too!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If you want to do it again, fry, just scatter
some more bait for me, OK?
And with that...I'm off!

You do not have to time it exactly_just be

first beat: [v], [^], and [>]!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Mirror Shield, you can lift it and throw
it around.

________________________________________
I hear there's a fellow on Windfall Island
who's collecting Skull Necklaces!


You know who it is, fry? I don't. Sorry.



What I CAN tell you is that those
piggish monsters you see here in the
Forsaken Fortress seem to carry those Skull
Necklaces around all the time.
Not that I think it's easy work stealing
anything from the likes of those guys.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I hear that somewhere out in the wide world
is a handy arrow that can freeze anything.


With something like that, you could even
freeze that nasty monster in the Forsaken
Fortress...for a while, anyway.

But then, what would you do with a frozen
monster, you say? Good question, fry.


Why, I'd say you'd give that thing a whack
and watch it shatter into teeny-tiny pieces!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
The little shop master on Windfall Island
apparently got his hands on a truly
amazing treasure.

He calls it Magic Armor or something like
that. It's a pretty cool magical relic,
from what I've heard.

If you want him to give it to you, try
staring deep into his eyes and winning
him over with flattery, fry!
Ahhhh ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Are you thinking you want to get into that
cave, small fry? The one that's protected
by the crazy winds on that island?

Heh heh heh! OK, then. Let me just tell you
a little secret...


If you go five squares south and one square
east from here, you'll reach Ice Ring Isle,
where you'll find an item that will make
you as heavy as stone!
If you get that item, you won't have to
worry about getting blown over by winds.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You'd best be careful sailing these waters
on nights when the moon is full.


Well, if you like pure, soul-freezing horror,
fry, then maybe you can handle it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
If you see seagulls flying all around some
sea waters, that's a sign that you need to
be wary, fry.

Because the seagulls flock to wherever
Big Octos appear... BIG OCTOS, I tell you!
Those things don't mess around!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hey, small fry, do you know about the
golden Triumph Forks?
They're there, I tell you... On that island...
The chart's there, is what I mean to say.
But the cliff there rises sharply, and even
if you wanted to climb it, there aren't any
ledges or footings for you grab on to.

So? What are you going to do, small fry?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You've seen those weird rings of light
that appear on the surface of the sea,
haven't you, small fry?

Did you know that some of those rings only
appear at night? Didn't think so.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
They say that inside the ring of rock
that makes up the perimeter of that island,
there lives an incredibly beautiful fairy!

But the thing is, nobody's ever met her.



Supposedly, the only way you'll ever meet
her is to take a ride on a whirlwind and
drop inside that rock perimeter from the
sky above. Doesn't sound easy, fry...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Beware the night when the crescent moon
faces up!


That's all I can tell you, small fry.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Out on the cape of this island is this crazy
dancing fool who can't tell day from night! 


The guy's nuts...but you've got to respect
someone who's not afraid to just let it
all hang out like that, you know?

I've been watching him, thinking I'd try to
learn that dance and compete with him
from out here in the ocean...

But I just can't seem to swing with that
crazy, funky rhythm of his.
That guy's incredible!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Do you know what a ChuChu is, small fry?
 


No, I'm not talking about the sound you
make when you kiss someone![?][?]
I'm talking about ChuChus!

They're those slimy, monster-like puddles of
goo that turn into blobs of jelly, stand up,
and start jumping at you like crazy when
you come near them. 
Well, in any case, there's lots of them on
that island over there, so if you see any,
I'd avoid them. They can get...nasty.

Now that I think about it, every once in a
while I see the potion brewer who lives on
Windfall Island come here...
Now why would he do that, fry?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
There's a real peculiar cave toward the
backside of this here Dragon Roost Island.


Yeah, real peculiar. But I doubt you'll ever
get there to see it, small fry_unless you
manage to sprout wings and fly, that is...

`Cause you won't be getting there otherwise!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
To the west of here, over on Dragon Roost
Island, you'll see all kinds of rocks.
Big ones, little ones...you get the picture.

Anyway, they say that long ago, there used
to be treasure hidden inside those things.


Who knows? There may still be some left,
so you should open your eyes and take a
good look around...from as high-up as the
sun to as low-down as your toes!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I hear the bird-people who live on Dragon
Roost Island east of here have invented
an incredibly useful device that they call
a Grappling Hook... No lie, fry!
I hear you can throw that thing at monsters
and use it to grab treasure they've hidden
in their pockets. Talk about cool.

Oh, and have you seen those imp-like
creatures called Bokoblins that hang out
on the lookout platforms at sea and stare
through their telescopes?
I hear those guys keep Joy Pendants hidden
in their pockets, so if you get one of
those Grappling Hooks, you can use it
to swipe their pendants!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I wonder how long it's been since the
light in Windfall's lighthouse went dark...


It was quite a grand sight, I tell you,
the way that ray of light shone out like a
shaft of gold through the cold darkness.
I used to gaze at it with dear Gillian...
Anyway, I bet if someone could shoot a
powerful spark into the top of that
lighthouse, it would light up again!

Of course, that's just my intuition
talking...


Then again, you should never doubt a fish's
intuition, small fry!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Let me tell you a little something about
that island over there, small fry...
The guy who lives there is named Tingle,
but he won't grow up and act his age.
He still dresses like a little kid.
That...is not normal.
Still, from what I hear, he can decipher
maps like nobody's business!
It just goes to show you that you can't
judge a person on appearance alone, fry!


Of course, the thing about this Tingle guy
is that when it comes time to pay his
deciphering fee, you'd better be ready to
fork over some serious dough.
Anyone who doesn't have a deep wallet
won't be reading any maps, that's for sure.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Let me tell you, something, small fry...
The school on that Windfall Island has one
gorgeous teacher!

But the thing is, this gang of four little
hoodlums is always causing trouble for her.
 

Those little delinquents like to cause all
sorts of trouble. They go climbing trees and
hiding behind buildings instead of going to
school... What a bunch of savages.
Somebody's got to scold those scoundrels
and set them straight for the sake of that
poor teacher! You hear me, fry?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Word is, they hold an auction every night
over there on Windfall Island.


Every night the people gather in the Hall of
Wealth to amuse themselves by spending a
little money. Ah, the rich!

Auctions may be a race to see who can bid
the highest, but I'll let you in on a little
secret: the key to winning an auction is to
be both patient and bold. I'm serious, fry!
From what I hear, they get some great
things up on that auction block, too.
...Like heart-shaped stuff, among other
things. Maybe that's just a rumor.
You should try it out, small fry.
You might just like it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You see that there volcano that's spewing
out lava like there's no tomorrow? Yeah,
well, they say there's a great treasure
hidden inside that thing.
The thing is, everyone who's ever tried
to get inside has just been blasted away
by the great balls of fire that come
shooting off the top.
If you want to get inside, you ought to go
find the island that's one square north and
four squares west of here. That's where the
power to freeze anything is hidden.
...Or so they say. Maybe it's not true.
But it wouldn't hurt to look, fry!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I wouldn't sail through these seas on nights
when the left half of the moon is missing...
You'll regret it if you do, fry!

I'm warning you! It's not my fault if you get
so scared that you can't go to the
bathroom at night anymore!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I met a really weird guy on the island due
east of here. He had a pack on his back
huger than any pack I've ever seen.
I mean, it was B-I-G, fry!
He said he was looking for treasure, but
what does he expect to find in a place
like that?

I tell you...the guy is completely obsessed!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You should come around these parts on
nights when just a wee bit of the left half
of the moon is missing.

...That's when IT appears, fry!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You've seen those weird rings of light that
appear on the seas at night, haven't you?


Yeah, well, those things are a sure sign
that there's treasure in the deeps, fry!


But let me tell you, there are some lights
that don't always shine. Yeah. There are
these special ones that shine like crazy,
but only when you open a Treasure Chart!
They say that those mark the spots where
the greatest treasures are hidden!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
They've got a shop over there on Windfall
island_a nice outdoor shop! Did you know
that, small fry?

And in that shop they've got this really fine
safe that looks to be brimming full with
riches...and they just leave it sitting
outside_day and night!
I tell you, one of these days that thing is
going to get hauled off by a thief!
Mark my words, fry!

Of course, if I were to find a thief in the
act of thieving, I'd stop the perpetrator
right there and catch the rat red-handed!

I'm sure if I did, the owner of that shop
would thank me. Yeah, he'd be happy.


...That would be the honest thing to do!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I've done a fish-fortune on you, small fry,
and from what I can tell, it looks like you're
fated to come to this place many times.

And the keys that control that fate are
none other than the lucky items known as
the Triumph Forks! Yeah, they're some sort
of magical utensils!
If you want to learn more about the
Triumph Forks, talk to that guy, Tingle!
That's what the fish-fortune told me!

Now, I know I may only be a fish, but my
fortune-telling is uncannily accurate!
You'd better believe it, small fry!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Tell me, small fry... Have you ever caught a
fairy before?


`Cause from what I've been told, when
you've been beaten to a pulp by monsters
and such, and you think that you've finally
met your match...
If you've got a fairy with you then you've
got nothing to worry about. Don't you
wish you had something handy for carrying
fairies around with you, fry?
If you want one, go south from here until
you see a miserable-looking submarine
floating on the sea. Look there!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Tell me, small fry, do you have any of them
Golden Feathers?


I hear those things are all the rage with
Rito ladies on Dragon Roost Island these
days. They just go ga-ga over them!

But the thing is, the only way to get a
Golden Feather is to defeat one of those
bird-monsters...or so they say.

Yup! Rito men who have girlfriends sure
have tough lots in life, I tell you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You've seen the boats sailing around here
with the real huge cannons, right, fry?
 

I bet you those things have their hulls
packed with treasure!


Of course, if you don't have a cannon
yourself there's no way you'll ever sink
one of them...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Tell me, small fry, have you ever heard of
the fabled set of Triumph Forks?


Well, it's right there, my young fry...
On that island... You know... A chart,
showing you where to find them...

Of course, getting it's the hard part.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So tell me, small fry, have you heard about
the golden Triumph Forks?
There are such things...

And there's a chart that'll show you where
to find them on that island there.


If you want it, try asking that huge,
grouchy-looking stone watcher!


I doubt you could even budge the thing,
though... You've got skinny arms, fry.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
A famed pictographer lives far to the north
of here on Windfall Island.


He's apparently real wise and talented
in the ways of pictography.


He's even said to have legendary
pictographs that he treasures above all
other things. He keeps them hidden away
in a secret safe, or so they say.
By the way, small fry...
What exactly is a pictograph, anyway?!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
So, tell me, small fry... Have you heard of
the golden set of Triumph Forks?
It's right there, I tell you! A chart that
shows you where they are! In that house!
If you want it, you'd better go in there
and scour the place from floor to ceiling!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
You ought to come sail these seas on nights
when the right half of the moon is missing...


It'll give you shivers, fry!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Tell me, small fry, have you ever heard
of the golden Triumph Forks?
They're there, on that island... Or, at least,
a chart leading to them is there.
Where's it hidden, you ask? Well, for the
answer to that, you'll have to ask a gull.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Oh, I've got some great information,
small fry! Lucky you!


If you use the treasure that's hidden on
that island there, the thing that vanishes
as soon as you get near it... It won't
vanish anymore! You know...IT!
I'm talking about IT! That thing that
appears on nights when a wee bit of the
right half of the moon is missing!
Don't you know what I'm talking about?! IT!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Long ago, there was this huge fairy who
lived to the south of here, in the forest
on Outset Island.

But now, all that's left is the ruins of the
fairy fountain where she lived...
It's sort of sad...

But to tell you the truth... I hear there
still IS a fairy there. Yup! She's still
alive and kicking down there, fry!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Tell me, small fry, have you ever been
caught in one of those cyclones?


The wind deity, Cyclos, uses those cyclones
to fly across the sea instantaneously, or so
I've heard. Could be just a rumor.

Boy, if you had that power, you wouldn't
have to spend so much time sailing back
and forth across the sea all the time.
Wouldn't that be nice, fry?
But let me tell you, there's no way he'll
give up his power easily! You can't get near
the guy, so you'll have to figure out how to
shoot him from a distance.
Don't you have a weapon that can pierce
things from a distance? You know, fffwip?
FFFWIP, I tell you! You get my point, fry?!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Listen up, small fry_this is just between
you and me...


On Outset Island, buried beneath the black
soil...there's some serious treasure.


I know it sounds like I'm trying to pull
your leg, but I'm serious. Try digging there!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
There's this amazing treasure inside that
freezing ring of ice over there.


But even if you wanted it and tried to get
inside, you'd just be frozen solid as soon
as you approached the shore.

But...if you go four squares north and three
squares west, you'll find the power to melt
any ice_no matter how cold!
Search for it, small fry!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Just a wee bit north of this island, I've
sometimes seen a merchant of incredible
girth with a monstrous pack on his back.

Now, what could he be doing on that lonely
little isle?


I tell you, there are some strange folk in the
world, fry...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Hey, small fry, do you know about the
Nintendo Gallery?


The only way in there is to hit a switch
that's way up high on the Forest Haven.


But the only way to do THAT would be to
bribe one of the gulls by putting a little
bait on your head!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
On the island due east of here lives an
old man who was once a master
swordsman. He's got proof of it, too:
he has a Knight's Crest.
Want to know what that thing is, fry?



Well, too bad... I can't go giving away
every secret!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I heard that beneath the big-head boulder
on top of the hill here on Outset...


...is where the greatest treasures of all,
the golden Triumph Forks, are buried.


But actually, fry, I must have misheard
or something...


`Cause this one guy told me that what was
actually buried beneath that weird rock
was a chart to this shard of something
called a Triforce. Whoever heard of that?
That's crazy! There's a big difference
between "Triumph Forks" and "Triforce"!
I mean, I think someone intentionally
buried something misleading there.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Small fry, there's a real heavy stone head
blocking a cave on that island. Don't you
wonder what's behind it? Don't you want to
get in there?
Heh heh! Let me tell you a great secret!



If you go north four squares and east three
squares to Fire Mountain, you'll find an
item that gives you the strength to easily
lift anything, no matter how heavy it is.
With that thing, you could lift that stone
and toss it out of your way as if it were
light as a feather.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
I tell you, lately no one around these waters
has seen the beautiful fairy who bestows
magic power. She used to live here, fry.

All anyone ever sees anymore are the
Big Octos that have been appearing
lately. Maybe they scared her off...
Oh no! I sure hope...they didn't eat her!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Northeast of here is the Forest Haven...
They say a truly unique kind of firefly
is indigenous to that place.
You heard of it, small fry?
It emits bursts of light in seven colors!
Supposedly it's as beautiful as a rainbow!


If you want to capture one though, you'd
best have a bottle to keep it in.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Lemme ask you something, fry...
Have you been using [R] to make your boat
jump? Well? Have you?

...Of course, going out to sea just to jump
around would be real dumb, if you ask me.


Anyway, what you can do is tilt [<][+][>] to
move your tiller just as you land...
That's how you make a sharp turn. If you
didn't know that, why don't you try it out?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

________________________________________
Have you seen it, small fry?
...The Ghost Ship?


`Cause it's real. It's even been seen here,
in these very waters...


On nights when the crescent moon faces
down... That's when horror rises...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
