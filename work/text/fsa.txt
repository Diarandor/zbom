--------------------
What is a text dump?
--------------------
A text dump contains all the text in a video game, ripped
straight from the ROM. I use a script to convert the ROM code
into formatted, readable text, in either TXT or HTML format.
Why is this useful? It is often useful, when theorizing about
Zelda, to have exact quotes handy. These text dumps put all
the text in the Zelda games at one's fingertips.

A word of warning though: internally, the ROMs arrange the
quotes in essentially random order. There is a little bit of
structure: for example, though one person's dialogue may be
split up into separate quotes, these quotes will generally
be all together, in order. But if you wish to find a specific
quote from the game, you will have to already know a few words
from the quote so that you can search through the entire text
dump. Any decent text editor should have a Search function,
and you'll need to use it to find anything specific in the
text dumps.


------------------------------------------------------
Where can I get the latest version of your text dumps?
------------------------------------------------------
If you downloaded this file off of a site like GameFAQs.com,
you might have an out-of-date version. This is because I only
submitted the text dumps to FAQ sites once, just so people
would know that these text dumps exist. Updated versions can
be obtained at this web site (Zeldalegends -
http://www.zeldalegends.net) in the Emulation section.
Compare the revision date at the top of this document with
the one in the files on my site to see if you have the latest
version.


---------------------------
How do you make text dumps?
---------------------------
I include the following information for those who are curious.
If you don't understand any of it, just skip ahead.

The first step in making a text dump is to have a copy of the
ROM. Then, if you have a quote from the game, you can search
for the text. Newer games (like OoT, MM, and LA) use standard
ASCII values for raw text, so it is possible to find the text
using any common text editor. Older games (like LoZ, AoL, and
ALttP), unfortunately, don't use ASCII standards, so it's
necessary to do a relative search using a hex editor like
Thingy. Then you can make a translation table that will allow
Thingy to translate ROM text into standard ASCII text. (There
are many freeware utilities available that will help you do
relative searches and make translation tables.)

To make things even more difficult, some games compress, or
encrypt, the text. For example, in Oracle of Seasons the hex
value "02 0E" translates to "Twinrova." ALttP uses compression
and doesn't use standard ASCII values, so this is the most
difficult game to dump. OoS and OoA use ASCII standards but
have text compression. Fortunately, I already have TBL files
for both of these games, so dumping is not as difficult as it
could have been. ^_^

After you have found the text (and you're sure you've found
ALL the text), copy and paste all the text you can find into
a new file. This is what the DMP files on my site are: all the
text I could find, copied and pasted straight out of the ROM.
Once this is done, I wrote a PHP script to parse the DMP file
and translate everything into a readable format (TXT or HTML).
Making a program is the easiest thing to do in the long run
(though something more powerful than PHP is usually preferable),
because it takes a while to find out what all the codes in the
ROM translate to. Using the standard Find/Replace function of
a text editor is too much work if what you're searching for
constantly changes.

Long ago, in the kingdom of
Hyrule, a wind sorcerer
named Vaati appeared.

Vaati terrorized the people
of Hyrule and kidnapped
many beautiful girls from
their homes.

When all hope seemed lost,
a young boy carrying
little more than a
sword appeared.

According to the legends,
when the boy drew his sword,
he split into four, the
four-who-are-one worked
together to vanquish Vaati.

The hero used his sword to
bind Vaati in a remote area
of Hyrule. The people
christened the blade the Four
Sword and built a shrine
around it. There it remained
undisturbed for many years.

Ages flowed by...

The wind sorcerer Vaati
broke free of his prison
and kidnapped Zelda, the
princess of Hyrule.

Princess Zelda's childhood
friend Link used the power
of the Four Sword to defeat
Vaati and seal him away
once again.

And, for a time, the people
of Hyrule believed that
their land was safe.

Until...

Awesome! You found this

Did you notice that there
are only kids here? All

No one wants to go home!
Not even me! No, sir!

Except...the girl in the
house with the red roof
is always crying.

I wonder if she doesn't like
it here.

What did you say? Is that
a letter from my sweetie?
Let me see it!

Hmm...uh-huh...
Oh...ah....

I'm so relieved.
My sweetie's OK!

But she was attacked by a
giant tornado and a dark
shadow that kidnapped her.

Can she be rescued?
Hey, you! Do something,
please!

Sweetie gave me this feather
as a good-luck charm... You
can have it if you help her!

It's great! You'll feel like
a bird as you jump around
light as a...uh...feather.

You can even bound over
giant holes!

This is all I have left...
I want you to have it.

You got a Roc's Feather!

With this giant bird's giant
feather, you can take off
and soar the skies!

Press the A Button to jump!
Press the B Button while
falling to swoop downwards.

Tingle hears that little

Perhaps if Tingle does his
best to be kind, he may meet
this fairy face to face!

Here's a good deed! I'll put

It's not fair...

If you see the culprit,

[sfx]Link!
Did you defeat that giant
stone eye-thing?

Thank you! By defeating
that beast, you rescued
me from my crystal prison!

Thank you, Link.
You have my gratitude!

The wind sorcerer Vaati has
regained his power. When he
last tried to conquer Hyrule,

he built a Palace of Winds
in the Realm of the Heavens.

So even now, he's
sure to be--

Link! You must first rescue
Princess Zelda. Act quickly!

I rule over Death Mountain.
High atop the peak, the
Tower of Flames stands tall.

Climb the mountain. One of
the maidens must be trapped
in the tower of raging lava.

Come, Link.
I shall guide you.

I didn't even know they
made bombs that big! Those
just can't be good.

If you value your life,
you'd better flee when
you see one of those things.

Oh, and one more thing:
you and that mad bomber
are like two peas in a pod.

You're practically identical
twins! What's up with that?
HEHEHEHEHEHEHE!

In Hyrule, four sacred jewels

And yet, in these dark times,
the knights are nowhere

even the jewels are now...

Link, all we can do is put
our faith in the light and
press on,

overcoming each obstacle
that confronts us.

My forest has lost its light.
Darkness covers it like a
shroud.

Link, will you go to the
forest? Perhaps you will find
some clues there.

In the heart of the forest is
a temple. The Dark Mirror
can be found there.

Long ago, a dark tribe
invaded Hyrule.

They were defeated and
imprisoned within the mirror.

The tribe's mirror prison was
then secreted away and
hidden in the forest temple

to sever its connection to
this world.

That Dark Mirror must never
fall into the hands of those
with evil hearts.

Yes, this Ganondorf you
speak of is a member of

But his intent is unknown to
me. He has flouted the law
and fled for the pyramid.

To reach the pyramid, one
must first pass the trial
of the Desert Temple.

The villain Ganondorf will
no doubt draw his last
breath failing this trial.

We've blocked the road to
the desert to keep other
fools from coming.

But considering the crisis
in Hyrule, we've no reason

Fill the house with
furniture and it becomes
too heavy to budge.

That's why I've had to leave
it entirely empty. It's a

Remember the order of the

Anyone who solves the
problem correctly gets a 250

Come on! Try the test!

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

_________________________________
That's right! You've got it!
Press and hold the L Button.
Then press [^], [v], [<], or [>].

That's the formation
shortcut technique!

In formation, everyone
can attack simultaneously.
That's great in battle!

Best of luck to you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

_________________________________
Oh, so that's the deal!
That explains everything!

That technique is only for

It's for changing formations
quickly and easily!

Basically, you only use it
if you're forming up!

Try to remember it when you
want to change formations.

Whaaaaattt?!? You're joking!

Hello. You've returned.
Please take this token of
our thanks for your help.

During the course of our
inquiry, we dug a secret
passageway in this village.

For example... Try digging
by the house of pots in the
southeastern part of town.

You'll find a path that lets
you walk to areas you
normally cannot. It's handy!

Take this shovel and use the
passage you uncover!

You got a shovel!
Dig in soft soil to find
some nice surprises!

You'll be much safer riding
my swift horses, I'm sure!

Our farm's right next door.
We've lots of carrots around,
so take some with you.

They'll come running if
you've got some handy.

Hm?
I've never seen you lads in

I'm spending my retirement

You may not believe me, but

You will press the L Button

That's it!!

If you hear a formation

Hrmm... I haven't seen

before...

I've dedicated my retirement
to teaching the secret of
adventuring to my grandkids.

I may not look like much 
now, but I was once a knight
in the castle.

I am a skilled adventurer,
a real professional!

Come now. I'm sure you
youngsters long for the
thrill of competition...

But you can't imagine the
rewards of working together
to accomplish a goal!

My granddaughters get along
fine now, but you should see
'em when I'm not looking.

I figure you and my
granddaughters are like
birds of a feather, eh?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Oh, Mr. Fairy! You coming to
my rescue has left me
overcome with emotion!

Let me thank you by sharing
some thrilling Tingle news
with you!

The oh so Tingle-esque
pastime of collecting Force
Gems is all the rage now!

In fact, I got stuck under
here trying to get the Force
Gem under this rock.

But you saved me! Clearly,
it was the power of the gems
that led you here to me!

Tingle believes without a
doubt that good things come
from collecting Force Gems!

Why, collecting enough Force
Gems may even turn Tingle
into a real and true fairy!

No doubt that's why you're
after the Force Gems, too,
isn't it, Mr. Fairy?

Let's be fair about where
we look and share the gems
equally, Mr. Fairy!

And with that, Tingle must
say his farewells!

...

...Don't follow me!

I mean, if they can toast
me, they're sure to burn
you to a crisp.

Oh, hey! I can teach you an

You bet No, Thanks

So right when they open
their mouths to breathe
fire, gulp! And then...

BLAMMO! What a great idea!

bombs in the lava!

Ugh! I can't believe it!

But the earth there has
crumbled to bits, making it
impossible to get there.

Whoa! Oh, whoa! That
big ol' house just
moved!

Yeah, all those stakes
stuck around the house
were such a pain.

But now that they're gone
I can just push that house
around all I want!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

_________________________________
Oh, not good! Someone built
a house here while I was
gone. That was fast!

It's covering the hole I
buried my most precious
belonging in...

If there were just some way
to move that house aside...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Gah! And I went to all that
trouble to plant stakes so
my house couldn't move!

Sheesh! What kind of vicious
grudge would make someone
do this to me?

This was an empty lot when
I built my house, so why
would anyone be mad at me?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

_________________________________
H-Hey! Did you see one of
those Gorons out front?

I don't know what he's
thinking, but he's been
shaking my house like crazy!

I planted stakes outside to
hold my house in place, but
that guy is stupid strong.

I'm Secret Agent One,

I'm guarding this here place
to make sure this mage don't

If you're looking for our

that building there.

There's a secret entrance
on the side. Go right on
in and see him!

I am Secret Agent Two!

I'm not supposed to move

But I can't say any more
than that to anyone outside
of our...secret guild.

But I CAN ask for some
help. The guild bylaws
say nothing about that.

If you feel up to it,
go see our head office.
It's north of here.

We're looking for a

If you're interested in what

in our office west of here.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

_________________________________
Shh! Keep it down, will ya?
I'm on a stakeout!

Call me Secret Agent Four.

If you want to help out, go

There's a throng of people
blocking the door, though,
so you probably can't go in.

Guys from the Seeker's Guild

All the people lined up here

That's why I'm here. I'm

You know, Secret Agent One!

I just wanted to thank all

it was the mages... But it
was just a misunderstanding.

If it weren't for you guys, 
we never would have cracked
this case. We owe you big!

We'd really like you guys to
stay here in the village
and join our guild.

But we understand you can't,
so we won't try to force you
to stay.

But good luck out there! I
know you'll pull through,
whatever you're doing!

Digging holes in woods this
big is tough work when your
shovel's been taken away.

We move four times as fast
in Deku Scrub formation
though, so it'll be a breeze.

You know, I doubt anyone
else could come up with
such a cunning plan!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

_________________________________
Thanks to Ganon, we were
awakened from our slumber!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

_________________________________
The Lost Woods is our
birthplace!

If you wander lost here for
too long, you too can
become a Deku Scrub!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

_________________________________
Uh-oh! I forgot about the
hole I dug as a joke
the other day...

I'll need to sneak away
later, grab a shovel, and
look for it...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

_________________________________
I captured the Great Fairy
so that if someone steals
my shovel...

he won't be able to
power it up!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

_________________________________
Where the heck did Decci
go!? That slacker should try
helping out once in a while!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

_________________________________
Soon, Lord Ganon's power
will change all of Hyrule's
forests into Lost Woods!

Once that happens, we'll be
able to travel freely!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

_________________________________
Gwee hee!

I locked up the shovel and
hid the key to keep
strangers from finding it!

And let's not forget
my impeccable work
guarding it personally!

There's no way anyone will
ever get their hands on the
shovel!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

_________________________________
Make sure that all who
enter the forest remain
here! Lord Ganon's orders!

But we're trying to build an
underground road that will
let us go anywhere...

Anyway, we've hidden
every single shovel we
could find!

If there are no holes, no
one will ever find our road.
We're absolutely brilliant!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

When you're done with the

be sure to put it back

[sfx]I am the Knight of Hyrule
charged with guarding
the blue royal jewel.

To my shame, I fell under
the sway of dark powers

and was transformed into
a base creature of magic.

The jewel was also cursed,
and it became a portal to
the Dark World.

I am sorry for the citizens 
of Hyrule who suffered...
and for Princess Zelda!

I trust that you are going to
the Realm of the Heavens
and the Palace of Winds.

However, you must first
gather the royal jewels

to reveal the path to
the Tower of Winds.

There are three other
guardian knights. I fear
they too have been changed.

Free them from their dark
curses and retrieve the
jewels!

The light must return to
Hyrule! I entrust you with
the blue royal jewel.

And with it, I place in
your hands the hopes of
all Hyrule!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

[sfx]Bearer of the Four Sword.

I am the Knight of Hyrule
charged with guarding the
green royal jewel.

The Four Sword was the seal
to Vaati's prison.

If you have it, that means
the seal has been broken.

Yet the one who enshrouded
me in darkness was not
Vaati! It was...

Ah! If the one who enchanted
me and turned the jewel

into a dark portal wanted
Vaati restored...

His goal must be to use
Vaati to remake Hyrule into
a land of darkness.

Listen to me, heroes. You
must never forget that Vaati
is not the only foe you face.

I will follow my brother
knight's lead and entrust to
you this green royal jewel.

Now go!
You and the Four Sword!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

[sfx]I am the Knight of Hyrule
charged with guarding the
red royal jewel.

Hear now the doom of the
knights. We were bested by
a foe with a mighty weapon.

He cast us into the Dark
World, where we and the
jewels were lost in shadow.

The Tower of Winds
vanished, and I...

No, WE servants of the
crown were turned into
monsters!

The man that defeated us
is also the same man who
created that shadowy imp.

A man from the desert
wastes... He is not Vaati.

Your dark twin was sent by
him to trick you into
breaking Vaati's seal.

I wonder where the fiend
got the amazing power he
now wields.

It matters not! None of
this allows me to aid
Princess Zelda.

And yet I cannot go on...

Brave ones...I entrust the red
royal jewel to you.

You now possess three
of them.

Obtain the fourth, and
bring light back to the
Realm of the Heavens!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

[sfx]Heroes! You've done well
to get this far...

I am the Knight of Hyrule
charged with guarding the
purple royal jewel.

Thanks to you, we have been
freed from the dark spells
that bound us.

You must now take the four
royal jewels past this
ice-bound temple and

fly to sacred grounds!

Then you can enter the tower
leading to the Palace of
Winds, where Vaati lurks.

Deep within the palace,
which soars above the Realm
of the Heavens,

a terrible darkness
awaits you all.

Yet if you do not dispel that
darkness, true peace will
never return to Hyrule.

The fate of Princess Zelda--
and all of Hyrule--rests
in your hands!

Hmph!
You spotted the entrance.
You have a keen eye.

This is the office of the
legendary Seeker's Guild.

We're investigating the
sudden appearance of those
suspicious mages.

We've reason to believe
they may be connected to
the vanishing children.

What do you say? You
seem talented enough.

Care to help us out?

Yes No

Oh, you'll help?!
That is spectacular!

There's something I need
you to do right away.

Four of our brothers are in
the village investigating
the weird mages.

They must have found some
clues by now.

Go and speak to the four
of them and see what clues
they've found so far.

The key to this mystery's
bound to be in those clues.

One of the brothers should
be right out here to the
left.

You have your orders!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

How's it going?
Is the investigation
coming along nicely?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

One of our members should

Come on back when you've
gotten clues from all
four brothers!!

I'm sorry, but I just don't

Why don't you think about

Yes, that does seem odd...

What do you believe the

I said I'd give you these

What else can I do?
Here, take these!

You got Pegasus Boots!

Of course...

Something's happened to
the six beautiful maidens
that protect the shrine...

That's it, isn't it?

Your powers of deduction
are truly magnificent!

We'll use your findings
to continue our
investigation!

Oh, yes... As thanks for
your help, I'd like to
give you something.

During the course of our
inquiry, we dug up a
hidden passageway.

Try digging by the
house of pots in the south-
eastern part of the village.

You should find a path
that will take you to places
otherwise unreachable.

You got a shovel!
Dig in soft soil to find
some nice surprises!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

_________________________________
Hello.
So tell me, is your shovel
coming in handy?

There's a hidden path near
the house of pots down to
the southeast.

Use it to go places normally
unreachable. Dig yourself
an entrance to the passage!

[sfx]However, there is something
that disturbs me.

When those...things...first
entered my woods, they
spoke of their dark lord.

"Ganon, Ganon," they
chanted. It was as though
they were...worshipping.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

_________________________________
[sfx]Ganon... I've heard that
name before. No, wait...
It was Ganondorf...

But, no... That man was of
the Gerudo tribe.

I can't imagine these
creatures worshipping
some desert nomad.

There's a Gerudo village
in the desert.

I doubt there is any
connection, but it cannot
hurt to check the village.

Beyond the village lie
ruins and an ancient
pyramid.

They are so old that no
living creature knows 
very much about them.

All I can tell you is that
no one who sets foot in the
pyramid ever returns.

If one of the maidens is
there, I fear for her safety.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

You've come to my aid?

You came to this pyramid of

Oh, thank you, Link!

...Princess Zelda?

Is this true? So she's still
in the clutches of those
creatures?

My sisters, show
yourselves please.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

You're all safe...
I'm so relieved.

Link, I'm in the Tower
of Winds.

This is no longer the
tranquil road to the
Realm of the Heavens.

Vaati's underlings have
turned it into a frozen
fortress.

Hurry, Link! Vaati's power
grows ever stronger,
even as we speak...

Would someone do something
about that woman? She's
blocking the door!

I tried asking, but she just
won't budge. I guess I
could try shoving her...

She looks kinda...heavy,
though. I doubt anyone
could do it alone.

get the last royal jewel
and bring back the tower!

You heroes have crossed
Hyrule and gathered three
of the jewels.

There's only one place
left to search.

Frozen Hyrule, where the
power of darkness keeps
spring at bay...

Like today! I was coming
home after running errands
but...I couldn't get back.

I mean, it started raining,
and the castle guards were
moving all the cannons...

The cannons are really old,
and they're not meant to be
used... It was really weird.

It's tied to a stake

I tried some spells from

But it's so frustrating!
Where in the world could

It's my book!!!

Well, I'll be!
Pretty impressive for
such a little fella.

Hm? The guy who owns this

I thought I'd just magicked
it out of nowhere! I'd

I really must return this.

My name's Dampe. I'm

at this here graveyard.

Only I can't take care
of a single thing right
now. I'm helpless!!!

These creatures, they are so
pleased. They treat our
world like their new home.

Listen up, boys.

Legends speak of a mirror
in which a dark tribe was
sealed away long ago.

I understand it's supposed
to be hidden now somewhere
in the Forest of Light.

The forest's been covered by
pitch-black clouds recently.
It's a Forest of Dark now.

Yep, no mistake about it...
Something bad's a-brewin'
there.

Tingle had an encounter with
a charming lady fairy! It
was fate! Destiny!

I was sneaking along behind
her when she went into a
castle...and never came out!

Surely she's been captured,
because she's too adorable
for her own good!

If you happen to see
Miss Fairy, gaze upon
her lovingly for me.

Oh...and save her, too!

We can't do much for you,

Tell me, travelers, what
brings you to these
borderlands?

Hmm...

I see... You come on word
of the maidens, eh?

Yes, this Ganondorf you
speak of is a member of
the Gerudo.

But his intent is unknown to
me. He has flouted the law
and fled for the pyramid.

To reach the pyramid, one
must first pass the trial
of the Desert Temple.

The villain Ganondorf will
no doubt draw his last
breath failing this trial.

We've blocked the road to
the desert to keep other
fools from coming.

But considering the crisis
in Hyrule, we've no reason
to stop you brave lads.

Go to the entrance of the
village and speak to the
guards at the gate.

Strike cracked blocks

You can also use the

Everyone knows that.

Except me. That's the first
thing I learned when I

Didn't help me much,
though... Urrrrk...

I set up a bomb to blow

I bet I could move it if I
could get enough people
together, though!

Say... The four of

OK, listen up. I'm real

Friends don't always have

True friends can do their

Just press SELECT

press the L Button!

Sounds nice, doesn't it?
I've got to get some

Such youth... Troubled
by the giants, are you?

We magic users have
enchanted two types
of medallion.

These medallions instantly
alter the shape of an evil
presence or make it vanish.

One of these medallions
is in that treasure chest
there.

It's one that I enchanted
myself. You may use it if
you like.

Oh ho ho ho!
At last, at last!
I've done it!

My lifelong dream...

A moving house!!!

It's made of a special
light, yet sturdy, wood!

And fire poses no threat
at all! It's absolutely,
completely fireproof!

Go on and try it! The four
of you, step outside and
push the house. It'll move!

There's one problem, though.
Fill the house with
furniture and it becomes
too heavy to budge.

That's why I've had to leave
it entirely empty. It's a
bit stark, but I like it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

_________________________________
Test it out! Move it around
this empty field! Shove it
to your heart's delight!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

_________________________________
Well now, I see you've
pushed it about a bit.
I'm quite jealous!

But why didn't I build it so
one person could move it?
What terrible planning...

So you've wandered into this
cave of no return, too, eh?

If you want to escape alive,
you must pull a long lever.

Grab it with the R Button,

That's just common sense.

I was all alone, though,

I died all alone...

Hello there, adventurers!

Do you want to know the
secret of adventuring?
Of course! Nope.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

If you don't want to know,
I won't force it on you!

Formation shortcuts!

Try it and see.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

_________________________________
How was it? Did you try?

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Hurry up, will you?
Press and hold the L Button.
Then press [^], [v], [<], or [>].
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

So you tried them!

And it's all clear, right?

Perfectly! Not at all...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

_________________________________
That's right! You've got it!
Press and hold the L Button.
Then press [^], [v], [<], or [>].

That's the formation
shortcut technique!

In formation, everyone
can attack simultaneously.
That's great in battle!

Best of luck to you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

_________________________________
You've been initiated into
the secrets of formations!

That's right! We do!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

_________________________________
Oh, so that's the deal!
That explains everything!

That technique is only for
the legendary hero with four
bodies and a single heart.

It's for changing formations
quickly and easily!

Basically, you only use it
if you're forming up!

Try to remember it when you
want to change formations.

Press the L Button and [^], [v],
[<], or [>]!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

_________________________________
Whaaaaattt?!? You're joking!
Or am I just not explaining
this correctly? Sigh...

What I wanted to say was
that this lets you change
formations super quickly.

You got it, right?
You'll remember it, right?
Press the L Button and [^], [v],
[<], or [>].

Something happened
to the 6 maidens that
guard our world.

Is that it?

Your reasoning is quite
amazing.

We'll base our ongoing
investigation upon your
remarkable theory!

Oh, yes! I'd like to give
you something in thanks
for your cooperation.

Ah, but your hands are full.
Come back when you're not
carrying anything.

Hello. You've returned.
Please take this token of
our thanks for your help.

During the course of our
inquiry, we dug a secret
passageway in this village.

For example... Try digging
by the house of pots in the
southeastern part of town.

You'll find a path that lets
you walk to areas you
normally cannot. It's handy!

Take this shovel and use the
passage you uncover!

You got a shovel!
Dig in soft soil to find
some nice surprises!

looks just like you.

Strange things are happening

Tingle's a tad upset about
all the monsters appearing
hereabouts!

If you're going to kick the
beasts around a bit, you'd
best have Force Fairies!

And no whining!

Grrr!
What a bunch of thugs!

Blowing up our foundation
with your stupid little
bombs!

That's right! This is the
foundation for the glorious
Lord Ganon's statue!

It's not done yet, so don't
go manhandling it, punks!

Just be careful, because if
there are holes to the north
and south of it, it'll move!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

I hate to admit it, but at
first, I wasn't sure I could

Thank you so much!

Hm?
I've never seen you lads in

I'm spending my retirement

about formations.

You may not believe me, but
I'm a former castle guard!
A professional adventurer.

Formations are the key to
working together and
performing great deeds!

If you're interested in

Hrmm... I haven't seen
you boys around here
before...

I've dedicated my retirement
to teaching the secret of
adventuring to my grandkids.

I may not look like much 
now, but I was once a knight
in the castle.

I am a skilled adventurer,
a real professional!

Come now. I'm sure you
youngsters long for the
thrill of competition...

But you can't imagine the
rewards of working together
to accomplish a goal!

My granddaughters get along
fine now, but you should see
'em when I'm not looking.

I figure you and my
granddaughters are like
birds of a feather, eh?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

_________________________________
Oh, Mr. Fairy! You coming to
my rescue has left me
overcome with emotion!

Let me thank you by sharing
some thrilling Tingle news
with you!

The oh so Tingle-esque
pastime of collecting Force
Gems is all the rage now!

In fact, I got stuck under
here trying to get the Force
Gem under this rock.

But you saved me! Clearly,
it was the power of the gems
that led you here to me!

Tingle believes without a
doubt that good things come
from collecting Force Gems!

Why, collecting enough Force
Gems may even turn Tingle
into a real and true fairy!

No doubt that's why you're
after the Force Gems, too,
isn't it, Mr. Fairy?

Let's be fair about where
we look and share the gems
equally, Mr. Fairy!

And with that, Tingle must
say his farewells!

...

...Don't follow me!

I don't want you to get the

Sure, we look like we're
getting along fine for now,
but this is just for show!

If we don't all cooperate,
Grandpa gets really sad.

But we all hate losing, so
when he's not looking, we
fight tooth and nail to win.

Do you want to know the
secret to winning?

Oh, this isn't good. I
brought my bombs all this
way, and then I dropped 'em.

They went right in the lava,
too. And I thought I had a
good plan...

I was gonna use them on the
monsters around here. You
should watch out for them.

I mean, if they can toast
me, they're sure to burn
you to a crisp.

Oh, hey! I can teach you an
IN-credible way of dealing
with those pesky things.

What do you say? Would
you like to hear it?
You bet No, Thanks
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

_________________________________
Great! I'll show you!
The problem is those things
have skin as hard as rock.

Even with my strength, it's
a waste to hit them. I can't
even make a dent!

But then it came to me! They
may be tough on the outside
but weak on the INSIDE!

So right when they open
their mouths to breathe
fire, gulp! And then...

BLAMMO! What a great idea!
...But then I dropped my
bombs in the lava!

Ugh! I can't believe it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

...Huh? Are you sure? You
might regret it later.

Well, I won't hold it

your lesson the hard way.

Because of everything that's

Maybe I'll go to the Eastern

I really need a vacation,
but it's always the first
step that's the hardest.

I mean, I can't really go
anywhere until the rain
stops, can I?

If you're thinking of going
to the palace, you'd better
be careful.

Wow! I'm surprised you're

I asked your buddy to bring
me some kind of weapon.

If I just had a weapon, I
could take care of every
last one of those monsters!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

_________________________________
Hey! I can't believe you're
out with all those monsters
around.

You know, if I just had a
weapon, I'd do something
about them...

But the problem is I can't
even get to the shed where
all our weapons are stored!

Ooo! I know!

Since you don't mind going
outside, can you slay all
the one-eyed monsters?

If you do, you can use
whatever you want from
the storage shed.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Really? Sweet! There are
lots of weapons and stuff in
the storage shed.

I'm sure you'll find a good
use for at least one of
them!

Take whatever you want.
Just get rid of all the
one-eyed monsters!

Here's the key to the

with you!

You got a small key!

One-eyed monsters have
been popping up in the
field a lot lately.

It's become too scary even
to set foot outside!

I'm too old to think about
fighting them off, and
my son is too cowardly...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Hah...

I know what my son says
about the weapons in the
storage shed...

but they're no match for
the one-eyed monsters.

A greater weapon may lie
in the cave to the north,
where my ancestors rest.

But the earth there has
crumbled to bits, making it
impossible to get there.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

_________________________________
Hmm... There must be some
way to get in that cave...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Oh! You again?

What? You slew all the
monsters?

Oh, thank you so much!
You can see my son for
your reward.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Finally, it's safe to go
outside again. And it's
all thanks to you!

Take this shovel in exchange
for your help. You can dig
holes with it!

There's a spot north of our
shed where there might
be an underground cave.

You should start digging
around there and try to
find it.

If you have a hard time
finding it, try going to the
Great Fairy's fountain.

The fairy there can make
this a powerful shovel!

You got a shovel!
Dig in soft soil to find
some nice surprises!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

_________________________________
Hey, I gave you a shovel,
didn't I? So go dig some
holes with it!?

Oh, wait! You've got too
much stuff! Come back when
you can carry something.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

_________________________________
...

What's that? You say you
destroyed all the one-eyed
monsters?

That's great! Thank you!

I really should reward
you! Uh... Gee... What
can I give you...

...

Umm... You're headed to
Hyrule Castle?

...Oh! I know!

There's this giant tree
that's blocking the path
to the castle...

But I dug a huge passageway
so I could get into the
castle.

Once I was done with it, I
sealed it up, but you could
dig it open if you wanted.

The passage to the castle
should be somewhere north

There's nothing but dirt up
there, so just keep digging
until you find it.

If you have a hard time
finding it, try going to
the Great Fairy's Fountain.

If you ask the Great Fairy
for help, she'll turn this
into a better shovel.

Hey! Your buddy told me all

You know... About how you
guys got rid of all the
monsters?

Now, you guys are going to
Hyrule Castle, right?

Well, you should know that
a giant tree's blocking
the path to the castle...

But I dug a huge passageway
so I could get into the
castle.

Once I was done with it, I

What's that? You need a

give you one.

The passage to the castle is
somewhere north of our

There's dirt everywhere up
there, so just dig around.
You should find the hole.

If you have trouble, though,
you can go to the Great
Fairy's Fountain.

If you ask the Great Fairy,
she'll turn this into an
incredible shovel.

You got a shovel!

Whoa! Oh, whoa! That
big ol' house just
moved!

Yeah, all those stakes
stuck around the house
were such a pain.

But now that they're gone
I can just push that house
around all I want!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Oh, not good! Someone built
a house here while I was

It's covering the hole I

Gah! And I went to all that

Sheesh! What kind of vicious

do this to me?

This was an empty lot when
I built my house, so why
would anyone be mad at me?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

_________________________________
H-Hey! Did you see one of
those Gorons out front?

I don't know what he's
thinking, but he's been
shaking my house like crazy!

I planted stakes outside to
hold my house in place, but
that guy is stupid strong.

Digging holes in woods this
big is tough work when your
shovel's been taken away.

We move four times as fast
in Deku Scrub formation
though, so it'll be a breeze.

You know, I doubt anyone
else could come up with
such a cunning plan!

The Lost Woods is our

If you wander lost here for

become a Deku Scrub!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Uh-oh! I forgot about the
hole I dug as a joke
the other day...

I'll need to sneak away
later, grab a shovel, and
look for it...

Soon, Lord Ganon's power

forests into Lost Woods!

Once that happens, we'll be
able to travel freely!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

_________________________________
Gwee hee!

I locked up the shovel and
hid the key to keep
strangers from finding it!

And let's not forget
my impeccable work
guarding it personally!

There's no way anyone will
ever get their hands on the
shovel!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

_________________________________
Make sure that all who
enter the forest remain
here! Lord Ganon's orders!

But we're trying to build an
underground road that will
let us go anywhere...

Anyway, we've hidden
every single shovel we
could find!

If there are no holes, no
one will ever find our road.
We're absolutely brilliant!

A weird mage is lurking

I can sometimes hear her
talking to herself, and
this is what she says:

That is most definitely a
clue! Go and report this
to the chief!

An apprentice mage
disappeared somewhere

"Protect..."

that away in your head!

Look! The mage is over

I was hiding over here,
watching her, when I heard
her call out suddenly...

She said, "Beautiful!"

Suspicious, isn't it? Maybe
it's part of a spell or
something! What's she up to?

You have a keen eye.

This is the office of the

We're investigating the
sudden appearance of those
suspicious mages.

We've reason to believe
they may be connected to
the vanishing children.

What do you say? You
seem talented enough.

Care to help us out?

Yes No

Oh, you'll help?!
That is spectacular!

There's something I need
you to do right away.

Four of our brothers are in
the village investigating
the weird mages.

They must have found some
clues by now.

Go and speak to the four
of them and see what clues
they've found so far.

The key to this mystery's
bound to be in those clues.

One of the brothers should
be right out here to the
left.

You have your orders!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

_________________________________
Oh, it's you!

So you've decided to help
us Seekers after all.
Yes No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

_________________________________
How's it going?
Is the investigation
coming along nicely?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

_________________________________
One of our members should
be right out this door and
to the right.

Come on back when you've
gotten clues from all
four brothers!!

I'm sorry, but I just don't
see the connection...

Why don't you think about
this some more and let
me know what you find?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

_________________________________
Oh, it's you. And you've
heard the clues gathered
by all our members.

... ... ...
Hm...yes...I see...
Those strange mages...

Yes, that does seem odd...

What do you believe the
mages' words refer to?

Is that so...
Let me ask you again.

What do you think the words
of the mages refer to?
Zelda Seekers Maidens
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

I said I'd give you these
boots, so you've got to
wear them! Put 'em on!

What else can I do?
Here, take these!

You got Pegasus Boots!

Press the A Button to
run with the grace of a
winged horse!

You know, it might be kind
of fun to get a running
start and ram into stuff!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

I said I'd give you these

Come get the boots when

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

_________________________________
Ah, it's you!

Well, have you come to a
conclusion?
Yes No

Of course...

Something's happened to
the six beautiful maidens
that protect the shrine...

That's it, isn't it?

Your powers of deduction
are truly magnificent!

We'll use your findings
to continue our
investigation!

Oh, yes... As thanks for
your help, I'd like to
give you something.

During the course of our
inquiry, we dug up a
hidden passageway.

Try digging by the
house of pots in the south-
eastern part of the village.

You should find a path
that will take you to places
otherwise unreachable.

You got a shovel!
Dig in soft soil to find
some nice surprises!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

_________________________________
Hello.
So tell me, is your shovel
coming in handy?

There's a hidden path near
the house of pots down to
the southeast.

Use it to go places normally
unreachable. Dig yourself
an entrance to the passage!

Lousy mages... What are
they up to?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Hmmm... We've looked all
over, but we just can't find
that mage's missing student.

How did she vanish?
Where did she go?

Would someone do something
about that woman? She's
blocking the door!

I tried asking, but she just
won't budge. I guess I
could try shoving her...

She looks kinda...heavy,
though. I doubt anyone
could do it alone.

Mostly, I'm just afraid that
woman will block the door
again, and I'll be trapped!

Dearest,

we've been married now
for 56 years, and you've
always been so good to me.

After I'm gone, please don't
let yourself be too sad
for too long.

If you get lonely, get
yourself a cute Cucco
as a pet.

If you do, perhaps you'll
be able to forget some
of your sorrow.

Good-bye, old timer.
We'll meet again one day.

Did you see the fields

I bought a vicious dog
to protect me, but...
it's a little TOO vicious.

In fact, I'm too scared
to go near it right now.

It's tied to a stake
outside, and I really
need to set it free.

All I have to do is break
the stake, but I'm afraid
to go near that dog!
