It's t-terrible, Link! Ze-ze-ze... Zelda has left the castle in Hyrule without any guard and is on her way here! This homing pigeon told me! Please try to find Zelda! Please! I'll look in town. You look up north. 
Link, did you find Zelda? Terrible things will happen if we don't find her soon! Zelda! Zelda! 
Such fine clothes... You must be a high-class girl! Rupees, jewels, everything! Give me your valuables! 
You... You're that boy! Don't tell me you followed me all the way from Labrynna to a place like this! You mean to stop me, don't you!?! I won't let you! I'll crush you this time! Take this! 
No!!! I'll remember this! 
Thank you for saving me from danger. My name is Zelda. You must be Link. I knew it at first glance. 
Princess Zelda! Thank goodness you're safe! What a mess! Why have you left the castle alone? 
I had a terrible dream. Link was attacked by a great shadow... I had to do something... Link, surely you can keep this for me. 
My goodness! It is too dangerous for you here. Let us go to my refuge. 
Welcome back, Link. 
You are tired. Close your eyes for a moment... 
Come back if you ever feel weary. 
Princess Zelda-- is she safe without hiding? She's always so careless. 
Ha-ahh... I wish I could marry Princess Zelda. 
Shh! I'm trying to hear Princess Zelda! 
As long as Zelda is here, the rules of the world will be followed, and this town, and even I, will be at ease! 
Get ahold of yourself! Or else I'll stop Onox! 
It may be irresponsible, but I'm counting on you. 
Princess Zelda is watching you! 
Link... The final trial has come. Head north to the Temple ruins shrouded in darkness... Onox's Castle is there! Please bring Din back safely. You understand the Essence of Seasons and Ages! May the protection of the Triforce be with you! 
I must rely on you, Link. We are all relying on you. 
Ow! Ow! Ow!!! Watch where you're goin'! You just hit Maple, the Great Witch Syrup's apprentice! Thanks to you, all the stuff fell out of my bag! The Great Witch will be mad! I can't find any Lon Lon Eggs, and now this... I'll just take the stuff you dropped, too! Finders keepers! 
You again? Thanks to you, everything in my bag flew out! You must be brave to hit Maple like this! I'll just take your stuff, too! Here goes! 
O-U-C-H-!!! You--AGAIN? Do you have a grudge against me or what? Thanks to you, all the stuff flew out of my bag! Well, I'll just take your stuff, too! 
AH! All my stuff flew out of my bag! I'll just take what you dropped, too! This'll show you what happens when you make Maple mad! 
Ouch... Back again? The stuff flew out of my bag! I'll just have to take what you dropped, too! 
We meet again! You know the drill! Fastest one wins. Ready..? Go! 
Hah, ha, ha! Now you're sorry! I have more stuff than before! See ya! 
Augh! You..! I'll remember this! 
Hmm! Not bad! But that's all you get today. 
Ouch... Watch where you're goin'! You just hit Maple, the Great Witch Syrup's apprentice! Oh my! That's one of those Lon Lon Eggs that are all the rage with girls now! It's just what I'm looking for! You're a boy! You don't need it. I'll give you my doll for it! 
This makes up for your bumping into me! See ya! 
Ah! . . . . . . Bye!
You've finally come. When the temple was buried, I thought perhaps you wouldn't come to see me. 
This Temple of Seasons is where we four spirits reside. 
I've waited a long time for you. Do you like spring? Or summer? Fall, perhaps? 
But no! You must love winter! Get the Rod of Seasons and visit us who wait in each of the four corner towers! 
Thank you for coming, child of the crested hand. The Spirit of Winter has been waiting for you. Din is our dear friend... Now, let me bestow the power of the Spirit of Winter on the rod you hold! When you swing the rod from atop a stump, the seasons shall change. In winter, the waters freeze and the snows pile up... Visit the other three spirits, too. 
You have come, adorable hero. I am the Spirit of Summer. In summer, vines grow tall and creeks dry up. Remember that. Ancient Hyrulean legends say the hero destined to overthrow evil has a (Triforce) on his left hand. Perhaps you are this hero. Now... I grant you the power of the Spirit of Summer! 
I am the Spirit of Spring. Rock-hard buds bloom in spring. It is a season of discovery. To think I can add to the power of the hero with the (Triforce) symbol! I loan you the power of the Spirit of Spring! 
I am the Spirit of Autumn. My turn has come! They say fall is lonely, but no! Pits are filled with fallen leaves and mushrooms are ripe for picking! When shadows fall on Hyrule, a hero shall appear... Is that hero you? Then I grant you autumn's power!  
Please hurry to Din's aid. 
Now the Rod of Seasons has the powers of all four seasons. This is all the help we can offer you. Oh, courageous youth... Din and all Holodrum are counting on you. 
Now bring the Rod of Seasons to us Season Spirits in the four towers! 
Bring the Rod of Seasons that is worshipped in the temple! 
Good luck! Only you can save Princess Zelda! 
Thank you! Your work has brought the seasons back to the land.

Really? Thank you! Take this! It's a Lon Lon Egg. These eggs are all the rage with cute girls! 
I wonder if Dad is all right up there on Mt. Cucco... 
Oh... Sorry. I didn't mean to impose. 
Oh! Talon always falls asleep! 
I really caught it from Malon when I got back! 
Oh, it's so hot! Even sitting by my prized Soothing Pool doesn't help! I need something creepy to send chills down my spine... 
Oh, my! That doll! It's so ghastly it gives me chills! Let me have it! -OK -No way 
Smart boy! Here! Take this fine Iron Pot! 
What? Wasn't my thanks enough? If you can swim, take a dip!

If Maple were here, I'd send her to Mt. Cucco for Mushrooms, but since she hasn't come back, I can't make my Magic Potion!

Ee, hee, hee! I can finally make my Magic Potion. Guess I'll open the shop soon. 
But where's that Maple wasting her time away? 
Hmph! Can't someone give me a Mushroom? 
I want to make a Cuckoo Clock better than any before, but I can't find a Wooden Bird that I like... One that's just breathtaking... 
You! That's an amazing bird you have! May I? -Sure -No way 
Breathtaking! Here! Take this!

I don't mean to ask too much... 
Go around, go around! If I could just oil it, it would go around more quickly... 
Engine Grease? Will that make it go quickly? Sure -Maybe not 
Really? Take my Phonograph! 
Go around, go around! Is it going too fast? 
It's no good if it won't go! 
Doo, dee, dee Hrm! You won't play for me? Fine!

I want to forge a great sword like those the Gorons of old are known for. But I'll never be able to forge it properly without Biggoron's secret. Do you know it? -Yes -No 
Oh... Come back if you figure it out. 
Really? Please tell me! 
So! That's how you forge it! I think I'll try it now. Hang on! First, Goron Steel... 
You forgot it? 
That's it! The Goron's Great Sword is reforged! I'll call it Biggoron's Sword! You made this possible, so you get the first one! 
I'll teach the secret of Biggoron that will let you use Biggoron's Sword in Labrynna. (Secret) Hear it again? OK -No thanks 
Come back if you forget the secret. 
You're awake! Please! Relax-- Join our jovial troupe of performers for a bit! 
Din is a popular dancer. Just seeing her dance raises one's spirits! 
Din has been caring for you since she found you. She's strong-willed but very kindhearted. 
Ah... Din always looks so lovely! But she seems smitten with you. I'm jealous. 
Oh! Your eyes have opened! Are you all right? I am Impa, the troupe's cook. And you are? Link? I see. Din, the dancing girl, found you collapsed in the woods. She's cared for you through your nightmares. 
You've awakened! Good! I worried while you slept! You're Link, right? How do you do, Link? I am Din. I saw a red flash in the woods, and when I went to see what it was... You were lying there. Mystery surrounds you, Link. I'm just glad you're better! Come! Won't you dance with me? 
Don't be shy! Dancing will be fun! 
Hya, ha, ha! I've found you, Din, Oracle of Seasons! You hid yourself well but you cannot escape Onox, General of Darkness! 
Get out of my way, boy! 
That's just our guise. I can't say it too loud, but we're really Hylian Knights. 
I am on a secret mission under the orders of Princess Zelda. Seeing Din dance is so moving. I won't let any harm befall her! 
Din has been caring for you ever since she found you... She's strong- willed, but very kind. I must keep her from harm. 
The Oracle is a lovely dancer. 
Link! You have awakened! It's me, Impa... Zelda's nurse. Din, the dancing girl, found you collapsed on the forest floor. She cared for you through your nightmares. Are you better? Then listen, Link. When I returned to Hyrule, Zelda told me that in addition to Nayru, Din, the Oracle of Seasons, was also in danger. So, as she requested... We've posed as a traveling troupe so we can sneak Din into Hyrule. 
You've awakened! Good! I worried the whole time you slept! You're Link, right? How do you do, Link? I am Din. You're the one who saved Nayru, the Oracle of Ages, in Labrynna. I saw a red flash in the woods, and when I went to see what it was, you were lying there. I'm glad you're feeling better! Come! Won't you dance with me? 
Don't be shy! Dancing will ease your heart! 
Hya, ha, ha! I've found you, Din! You hid yourself well, but you cannot escape Onox, General of Darkness! 
So! You're the boy who defeated Veran, Sorceress of Shadows! I'll not fall as easily as she! 
HAAA! Link! 
Eee hee hee!!! Veran, Sorceress of Shadows! Twinrova will not let your deeds be wasted! Look, Veran! The troubles you caused now burn as the Flame of Sorrow! When the Flames of Destruction and Despair are lit, we will offer up our sacrifice, and the dark rites of the Gerudo will be complete! Then the Evil King shall return! 
Accept our quest, hero! 
That was fun! You're a good dancer! It's been some time since I had such fun! Hey! Your left hand! It has a (Triforce) on it. That is a sacred mark in Hyrule. If it's the true symbol, then you are a hero with a special fate, Link. A special fate! Link, I... Umm... Nothing! Let us dance!

The seasons are a mess! Winter goes straight into summer... What's going on? 
I saw an odd girl in strange garb carrying a Ribbon. She was east of town... I think. 
I hear some animals in the wild are used to people. Maybe you can make friends! 
Maybe she's a princess from a foreign land. I told her it's dangerous beyond the village, but she left anyway. 
There are eight things called essences hidden across this land. What happens if they're brought together? 
How long will the seasons stay like this? It makes me so depressed. 
I feel a little better, thanks to Princess Zelda! 
Princess Zelda was taken away by some beast... What's going to happen now? 
I'm so glad the village is back to normal. But who changed the seasons around, and why? 
Do you know of the Hero's Cave near the Western Coast? The Hero's Sword is said to be hidden there, but no one has ever found it. 
There's a giant root north of town. I wonder what it's from. 
The area to the east is awash in green! I'd go paint it if I were younger... 
I guess seeing scenery from all the seasons is kind of nice... 
I recently saw a beautiful girl I'd never seen before. Is she from this town? 
Up north is a place of strange power that stops any who would approach. But it was never there before. 
Before we knew it, our guardian grew so big... It's so strange. 
Zelda is with you. Everything will be fine now. 
It was my only wish, but with Zelda kidnapped, it's too late... 
The seasons seem to have returned to normal. It's another gift from the town's guardian! 
Our guardian, the Maku Tree, stands beyond the gate to the east of town. It's said a hero with a sword will come to speak with him. I wonder if it's true... 
The world seems so vast... Here in Horon Village, the seasons have all run amuck. I wonder if it's the same in other lands... 
Tales tell of a curious object carefully hidden deep within the Moblin's Keep. 
The clouds up north are moving in strange ways. It gives me a bad feeling... 
I knew something bad would happen... 
After troubles like that, you truly appreciate nature's gifts. 
It goes from hot to cold in a flash. The seasons are in utter chaos! What will it do to this year's harvest..? 
Do you know of this land's mystical rings? -Yes -No 
Really? Well, my grandpa's wedding ring is enough for me. 
Well... If you don't wear your rings, their powers won't help you. If you want to know more, go see the jeweler. 
To the north is a huge beast like none other. Have you seen it? 
No matter how much I till the field, my crops won't grow... 
I must work hard to prepare for the day Zelda returns. 
What will happen to this world? 
Life has returned to the land! Our harvest is saved! 
If you get onto the flower, you can shoot up the cliff, too! It works only in spring when flowers bloom, so I'm getting my fill of it! 
Now it's just a bud, but it'll be a huge flower in spring. If you climb on that flower... I can't wait! 
This flower is cool! In spring, it shoots you into the air! 
I'm tired of the flower. 
Hey! C'mon! Play with me! 
This is the house of the wise Know-It-All Birds. See them if you have questions! 
The seasons here change like the wind. It's strange... 
Do you know of the Owl Stones? -Yes -No 
I knew it! That's common knowledge now. 
Ahem! Then I'll teach you. Owl Stones are mystic statues that give advice when a certain seed is placed on them! 
When I grow up, I'm gonna beat that Dark General guy to a pulp! 
They say a princess named Zelda lives far away. I hope to meet her. I wonder if she dances as well as Din does? 
Seeing Princess Zelda makes me happy somehow. 
Give him one for me, too! 
It's terrible! My dear Princess Zelda is gone! My dreams have all faded!!! 
In the west part of town are the Know-It-All Birds. See them if you have a question. 
You can burn small saplings! Just be careful with the flame! 
Some trees bear Seeds other seasons, not just spring. 
I hope my sister is all right. She said she was looking for someone, but with the village as it is, I'm worried. 
My dog's name is Flash! He's good at fetching! 
They say a great one has come to the village! Who could it be? 
These adults are all shoutin' about somethin', but I don't know what! 
This is Horon Village! Hey! I've never seen you before. The Maku Tree? Head east. 
The seasons are all messed up. It's bad for my skin... 
Lands outside the village are filled with monsters! I'm too scared to go out alone! 
I have a Member's Card. That stuff is mind-boggling! 
My wish is for world peace. I don't want any more weird things to happen. 
I have to see Princess Zelda! I'll never give up hope! 
It's just AWFUL! Princess Zelda was kidnapped! What do we do? 
This is Horon Village! Hey! I haven't seen you in a while! 
Hwaaa...... Wh-who's that? Did you wake me? Who are you? Hmm... What?!? Din was taken while I slept? There's no sign of the Temple of Seasons?!? This is awful!!! Guarding the oracle is my duty... Alas, how I've withered! 
What's to be done, Link? With the seasons in chaos, the land is robbed of the very essence of nature, draining all of my might! Can you save Din in my stead? It is all this Maku Tree has ever asked! I sense evil on the Northern Peak, where the Temple of Seasons rested! Onox has cast a shadow on the Northern Peak. I think you will find him there. You'll need the eight Essences of Nature that lie sleeping in Holodrum. Gathering all eight is the only option. The essences possess the sacred power of nature, with which you can break the shadow barrier and save Din. Shall I repeat it? -Yes -No 
Then I give you this key. Go to the Giant root near the lake up north! The first essence should be there, but I'd expect some resistance. Be careful! I'll just--ahhm, rest until--ohh, no energy...ZZZ 
Hwaaah... The Giant root! Be careful... Hohhm...ZZZ 
Hwaaah... It's me, the Maku Tree. Some of the Fertile Soil has come to me, too. I already feel stronger. Oh, in my dreams, I saw the Temple of Seasons in a strange land I do not know. There I saw a precious item that will aid you, Link. That is all I can see now... Hohm...hmm... 
Hwaah... The Temple of Seasons, Link. A precious item... It will aid you... 
Hwaah... Use the Rod of Seasons. Go to the Eastern Woods! Hohhm... 
Thank you, Link. I, too, received part of the Gift of Time! I just dreamt of Spool Swamp out west. Something is afoot there. But I can see no more... Hohhm... 
Hwaah... Spool Swamp out west--something is afoot...ZZZ 
Hwaah... Thank you, Link. I, too, feel the Bright Sun! I dreamt of the waterfall on the mountain north of Holodrum. Perhaps the next essence is near there... 
Hyaah... Hohhm...ZZZ... 
Oh, Link... Hohhm...ZZZ... 
Hwaah... Hohhm...ZZZ... 
Hwaah... Hohhm...ZZZ... 
Hwaah... Hohhm...ZZZ... 
Oh, Link... Hohhm...ZZZ... 
Hohhm...ZZZ... 
Hwaah... Hohhm...ZZZ... 
Hohhm...ZZZ... 
Hwaah... Hohhm...ZZZ... 
Hwaah... Thanks to you, my strength is returning! Good luck, Link! 
Link! Be wary! It's the final Essence of Nature! 
Link! You already have the eighth essence! The Changing Seasons have filled me with my former power! I have something to give you now, so come see me! 
Link! You've finally gathered all eight Essences of Nature. You've become a true hero who understands the Essences of Nature. You are hope for all that live! Take this seed! 
Link! Surely now you can defeat Onox, the General of Darkness, and free Din, Oracle of Seasons! 
Gwah, hah, hah! Some hero!!! 
Come if you dare, Link! If you are their so-called hero, then their hero is no match for my powers of darkness. Gwah, hah, hah! 
Thank you, Link! I, too, feel the Bright Sun! But the powers of darkness do not weaken... Instead, they grow stronger... How can this be? Link! I dreamt of the waterfall on the mountain north of Sunken City. Perhaps the next essence is near there... 
Something's not right on the mountain north of Sunken City. 
I, too, grow in might under the Soothing Rain. I had another vision just now. I saw a lake shaped like eyeglasses... 
I saw Eyeglass Lake in my dream... 
The Nurturing Warmth has brought me balmy weather, too! I dreamt of a huge waterfall in the mountains north of Sunken City. Something may be there... 
I dreamt of a huge waterfall in the mountains north of Sunken City. Something may be there... 
The Nurturing Warmth has brought me strength! I saw a dream of Link inside vast ruins. Perhaps an essence is hidden in some. 
I, too, grow mighty under the Soothing Rain! I just dreamt of Link looking through ruins. Perhaps one of the Essences is hidden in some. 
An essence ... in ruins... 
Say, Link! The Blowing Wind reaches me, too! I dreamt of a cemetery west of Holodrum. Could an essence lie there..? To get there, find a way across the sea. 
Could there be an essence in the cemetery? But how can you cross the sea? 
Say, Link! The Seed of Life has given me new strength! Now for the last Essence of Nature! But this time, I saw no dreams... So I rely on you, Link. It is somewhere in Holodrum. Good luck! 
Say, Link! Now for the last Essence of Nature! I must rely on you, Link! It lies hidden in Holodrum. Good luck! 
Link, you must defeat Onox, General of Darkness, and save the Oracle of Seasons, Din! With Din's help, perhaps you can reach Twinrova! Good luck, Link! 
So the item was actually the Rod of Seasons. New roads will surely open with its power! I dreamt of woods in the east... There may be an essence there! Link, can you go for me? 
Hurry, Link! The powers of darkness are spilling forth! You should be able to reach the entrance to Twinrova's lair! Princess Zelda needs you!!! 
Link! You must not fall prey to Twinrova's trickery! We must not be not misled by an easy path! Hurry, Link! The powers of darkness grow ever stronger! The passage at my roots should take you to Twinrova! Good luck, Link! 
Hwaah... Say, Link! As peace returns to Holodrum, so I return to peaceful rest! 
My husband was a master diver! But now he's old, and he's hidden his diving gear and gone off somewhere. 
Have you seen my husband? I knew he'd like you. 
The city is so quiet lately... What happened? 
They say the Maku Tree in Horon Village produces magical seeds at times. What kind of seeds could they be? 
Great Maku Tree of Horon Village! Please, oh please, save Zelda! 
My husband finally came back home! 
My pop's a master diver! He had a secret diving spot, but he never told me where it was. Stingy guy... 
I'll find his secret spot someday! You don't know, do you? 
Pop finally approved my skills and let in on his secret! Now I can be the new master! 
Recently some monsters settled in the village. They just sit there mumbling, making Bombs... 
Just when my time comes, Princess Zelda gets kidnapped? I'm so worried, I can't swim! 
I'm gonna learn to hold my breath the way Pop did! 
I hear there's a creature that can swim up waterfalls! What kind of creature is it? 
I want a pet-- one that will always be at my side! 
I wonder where the monster that came to town came from? I hope we can be friends! 
They said a bad guy kidnapped Princess Zelda. If I'd been there, I'd have stopped it! 
Legends say some sort of treasure sleeps on the summit! It's a boy's dream! I think about it so much I can't sleep! 
The Mysterious tree on the edge of town bears Gale Seeds. They'll take you anywhere in a flash! They're a big help! 
They say there's a huge tree in Horon Village. Someday I'm gonna use Gale Seeds to go see it... 
I heard Twinrova kidnapped Princess Zelda, but what on earth for..? 
The whole city's flooded, but since I can't swim, I'm just here blowing bubbles. 
What's essence? What's darkness? What's an evil king? It's so hard... 
Who's the oracle? Who's Din? Who's Onox? It's so deep... 
Can I still show this bubble to Princess Zelda? 
With the seasons out of order, the mountain snows melted suddenly, flooding town. I can't even leave the house! It's terrible! 
Delicious Spring Bananas! There's a tree on the top of Mt. Cucco, but with the seasons like this, there may be no fruit. 
It may just be a rumor, but they say there's a giant up in the mountains. He sounds scary, but I want to meet him! 
I'm thinking of moving out of town, but I don't know where to... 
It sounds like Princess Zelda was kidnapped. How frightful... 
I came here from Sunken City, but I can't get used to not having water around. 
What do you plan to do with me?!? 
As you know, if I imprison the Oracle of Seasons and bury the temple that houses the Season Spirits, the seasons of Holodrum will be cast into chaos, the bountiful gifts of nature will rot, and all living things perish!!! 
That is the world of darkness that I long for! 
No, Onox! No! 
GWAH, HAH, HAH! 
Yaaaaa! 
Down, Temple of Seasons!!! Spring, summer, fall, winter... Fall into chaos! 
Then the Flame of Destruction shall burn with the Flame of Sorrow, and the Evil King shall return! 
Evil King? No! 
Hah, hah! You don't even know! 
I thank you for paying to fix my door. 
Don't do it again. 
...I'd like to say that, but I cannot take what you do not have.
Shh! Don't tell! 
If you want true power, then slay the four golden beasts that roam the land. Then I shall grant my power to you. So far, you've slain (Number of beasts slain). 
You have slain all four golden beasts! Sir, you are worthy of true power. Take it! 
How you use the power is up to you, but do not be tempted to abuse it... 
I have nothing more for you. 
I'm Ricky! Th-those are my gloves! You brought them back? Thank you! 
In exchange...
We made it! Spool Swamp is up ahead. I'm going home, so you can find me there! See ya! 
Ew! It smells like medicine... I can't stand it! See ya... 
Press A to punch, or save power to unleash a tornado. I can also jump small holes or cliffs. 
But if you beat Blaino, you must be tough. What's your name? Link? Cool name! I'm Ricky. Nice to meet ya! Here, Link, take this flute. If you need me, just play the flute. I'll try to find you. 
First, I'll take you to Spool Swamp. Get in my pouch! 
Link! Wow! To think we'd meet here! Spool Swamp is my backyard. If you go south from here, then around and back up, there it is. I'd go with you, but I can't do a thing without my gloves 
... A guy named Blaino took them when I lost a match to him. 
But if you beat Blaino, you must be strong!
If you move toward a hole, I'll just jump right over. I can clear one hole easy. Give it a try. 
A cliff like that is one leap. I'll jump if you move up to it, so give it a try. 
Bwee! I found somethin' weird! 
If we catch it and sell it, we'll be rich!!! 
And the Great Moblin will be very pleased!!! 
Dee! Dee! 
Bwee! Let it go? Then you can pay us for it! 50 Rupees! -OK -No way
You're smart! But 50 Rupees is too cheap! Give me 30 more! -OK -No way
Bwee! You'll regret it, kid! 
Bwee! Smart, kid! Thanks! 
Bwee-hee-hee! We're rich! 
Bwee-hee-hee! Very pleasing! 
You saved me! I'm Dimitri. What about you? Link? That's a weird name. But starting today, Link is my friend. If you play that Strange Flute, I'll try to come find you. 
We sold it! We're rich! 
The Great Moblin will be pleased! 
Hoh! I found something weird! 
It's a monster! It came to attack the city--it did! 
We must protect the city! Hah! Take that! 
We're protecting the city! But without weapons, we're helpless. 
There's nothing to fear now! Let's go out on patrol!!! 
Hoh! 
What about the city's safety? 
Link! I've been trying to find you. We're friends! You help me... I help you, too. If you need me, play this flute. If I hear it, I'll come. 
We're the city's Safety Patrol! 
We shall protect the city! 
The monster went off somewhere. 
It got scared and ran off! 
And we were gonna let it join the Safety Patrol, too. 
Bwee! You don't have enough! 
Do you have Bombs? -Yes -No
I chomp when you press A. And I swim like a fish--even up waterfalls. You can also carry me using the Power Bracelet. 
Not that way! 
Get on my back. 
You saved me. I am Dimitri. You can't swim? I can even swim up waterfalls. You helped me, now I help you. 
You can carry and throw me when you use the Power Bracelet. Want to try? 
I even swim up waterfalls. Try it! 
Bwee! Give me that banana! 
The Great Moblin loves Spring Bananas! 
Bwee! Be a good kid and hand it over--or you'll meet a sad fate! 
Gmph, gmph, GULP! 
Bwee! He ate it! 
Get him! 
Bwee! Bwee-heee! 
Bwee-heee! He got me! 
This is one brazen bear! 
Bwee-heee! He got me! We'll avenge this! 
I am Moosh. I got startled when they asked for my banana. Are they OK? I'm kind of worried. 
Before we forget, we want our revenge! Get ready-- both of you! 
...Is it over? Bwee!!! We lost! Next time'll be different! Retreat!!! Bwee! 
Thank you for helping me out. Tell me your name. Link... Umm! I remembered it! I can help you if you like. If I hear your Strange Flute, I'll come find you. 
Not so fast! We'll get you! 
Oh! Water, water everywhere! I must leave such a frightful place! Until next time... 
Sniff! Sniff! There's a Spring Banana tree up there. But until the Rock Flowers bloom in spring, I can't climb up to it... Can nothing be done? 
You brought me a Spring Banana! Is it for me? I happily accept! 
Tap A to hover, or hold it to save power for a ground pound. But water is my weakness. The shallow stuff is one thing, but I can't take deep water, so be careful. 
I'll give you a ride anywhere. 
Link! Why are you here? I find myself another banana, I run into Link... It's a busy day. 
Thank you for helping me. Link's always out and about. I can help you. If I hear your flute, I'll come find you. 
Gmph, gmph, GULP! So tasty! That was great. I am Moosh. You fed me, so I'll help you. 
Hold A to power up. If you build enough power and let it go, I'll pound the ground. Try it. 
I can float if you tap A. If you move as I float, you can float across pits. Try it. 
Gmph, gmph, GULP! Delicious! Link, let's go! 
I'm da legendary champ, Blaino! You want somt'in'? Den earn it in da ring! Will you bet 10 Rupees? -OK -Nah 
Hyuh, hyuh. Dat was smart. 
Hyuh, hyuh! You'll learn... Lissen up! We trade punches 'til one of us gets knocked outta da ring. And no items! If you break da rules once, da next match is for 20 Rupees. And no rings! Only fists! Got it? -Got it -No 
You ain't got enuff Rupees. Don't play tricks, kid. 
You ready? C'mon! C'mon! 
Hyuh!!! I lost! Yer fists are golden, kid! You da new champ! Here! Take dese. 
If yer mad, tell it to yer fists!
What ugly form! Who's yer coach?
Yo, champ! You come to fight? Da purse is 30 Rupees. 
Hyuh! I lose. You're good! Well, here's yer 30 Rupees. 
Huh? Once more? -Yeah -No way 
Hyuh, hyuh! You'll learn... Lissen up! We trade punches 'til one of us gets knocked outta da ring. And no items! Dat means no rings, neither! You cheated, so the bet goes up to 20 Rupees. Got it? -Yep -Nope 
You want in the swamp? Well... Actually, I lost the key to open the floodgates! 
Oh! That's where I left it! That should open the floodgates. You can get to the keyhole from that puddle outside. 
Did you open the floodgates? The vines there get so overgrown in summer! 
Link! Are you all right? Actually, I am the nurse of Hyrule's Princess Zelda. And Din's no dancer either. She is actually the Oracle of Seasons who wields control over the forces of nature. Zelda has mystical powers that told of a curtain of shadow drawing around Din. I was instructed to take her to Hyrule in secret.
Link! Are you all right? That which Zelda foresaw has come to pass... Princess Zelda gave me this quest... But, ow! I've been wounded, and I won't be able to travel for some time... Link, I know not why you were lying in the woods, but... You and Din were fated to meet. If the (Triforce) on your left hand is real, then you may be the hero who will save the world. Please! Use your power to aid Din! 
Please take my message to the Maku Tree in Horon Village. The Maku Tree is the guardian of all Holodrum. Surely he can help. 
Go with caution! 
A gnarled root? Go straight from here. I am sure I saw one there.
The eastern woods? You mean the Woods of Winter, right? They lie east, then north, of the village.
A swamp? You mean Spool Swamp? Find it north then west of the village. It's filled with beasts stronger than any you've seen so far.
Sunken City... I've heard of a town in the east. Try there!
Ask others for aid if you must. People, even animals, may surprise you.
An eyeglass- shaped lake? I think it lies east of here. 
Hmm, ruins..? Perhaps Tarm Ruins? They lie far to the northwest. 
A desert? I know Samasa Desert extends east from town. 
But one essence remains! It will be difficult, but you can find it! Good luck!!! 
It is nearing completion! Good luck! 
I rue this day! Zelda has been taken and the villagers have been beaten into despair! Link! You are our only hope! Find Zelda, please! 
Where can the Temple of Seasons be hidden..? Does no one have a clue? 
First Labrynna, now Holodrum has come to an hour of tribulation! Link, I always come to you in need... But there is no one else I can count on! Please! Will you rescue Din? 
It's horrible! a "temple," like, fell into Subrosia! Umm, what's a "temple"?
Subrosia is a secret place. 
!! ! ! Someone's following me! 
Umm...I, like, lost something. I must return in secret, without being seen!!! 
Everyone went to gather rocks at the "temple" up north. 
There are nice- sized rocks near the "temple" up north. 
Melt it down! These furnaces can melt any metal! 
Right now I'm melting and mixing two kinds of ore. 
You can get to the northern "temple" from here. 
We're gathering chunks of ore to melt in the furnaces. 
The ore is all in chunks. 
I want to break this ore-filled rock, but it's too hard. A Bomb Flower could break it, but they aren't in bloom. Some guy down south says he saw one, though. 
Oh! That's a Bomb Flower! Thanks! OK, let's break it! 
That was great! Now we have plenty, thanks to you. If you ever need any ore melted, come to the furnaces. 
You helped us before, so come see us if you need any ore melted. 
This furnace can melt any ore into liquid goo. 
I've seen a Bomb Flower. I saw it at Lava Lake down south. 
What's that? It's so weird. I'll trade you this ore for it! Thanks! 
Let's go bury some treasure. 
Make sure no one sees us. If anyone does, run! 
That's good! Come on! Let's go find more treasure! 
Doh! Someone's here! Run!!! 
Will anyone see us this time? 
We're OK. Let's go. 
They took your precious item? They're always up to no good! Those foolish pack rats are famous around here. I just saw them with a dirty feather. Who would want that? 
Two Subrosians? You mean those weirdos who collect Rupees and other trash? They live in the weird house to the west. 
That hole goes to the "temple." 
Who would want a dirty feather? 
Hard Ore is said to be the best. 
My name's Rosa. My favorite Ribbon floated out to sea... I, like, wanted to go explore the "temple," but I can't go out like this! 
What a cute Ribbon. Is it for me? -Yep -Nope 
Ohh! I, like, want a Ribbon! 
Wow! Like, thank you! 
Since you're so nice, I'll go on a date with you. Let's go look in that "temple." 
Do you wanna go on a date? -Sure -No way 
OK! I'll follow you. 
Hey! I want you to ask me out! 
I'll follow you anywhere. 
As long as we're together, I can unlock any door you want me to. 
Does this Ribbon look good on me? 
Where are you going? 
I'm gonna give Rosa something she likes so she'll date me. 
I heard Rosa lost her Ribbon. I'm looking for something else she'll like. 
You can find Star-Shaped Ore in the sands around here. 
I wish I could go on a date with Rosa just once... But how do I get her interested? 
Rosa's key can open any door, even ones in the "temple." 
Rosa, the pop star, has been seen around here a lot lately. 
You went on a date with Rosa? Really??? I'm gonna give Rosa a present and get her to go on a date with me, too. 
Rosa has been so happy ever since some guy gave her a new Ribbon. But I heard he's a total dork. 
You can dig up treasure on this beach... Star-Shaped Ore! 
Rosa seems so sad lately... Is she waiting for someone? Don't tell me it's you..? 
If you mix Red Ore and Blue Ore, it makes Hard Ore. 
What? You're dating Rosa? What present did you give her? 
I'm so jealous! I want to date Rosa!!! 
You and Rosa? No way! You're not on a date, are you?!? 
I had so much fun. I hope you'll ask me out again. 
You have Red Ore and Blue Ore! Did you come to mix the two to create Hard Ore? -Yep -Nope 
Is that so? 
Then we'll get right on it. 
OK, here goes! 
Your Hard Ore is done. Watch out! It's hot. 
I'm workin' hard meltin' ore! 
A cute Ribbon I'll trade for Star-Shaped Ore. 
Rare Peach Stone I'll trade for Ore Chunks and 10 Ember Seeds. 
A Big Bomb Bag I'll trade for 10 Bombs and Ore Chunks. 
A seed ring I'll trade for Ore Chunks. 
Silver Seed I'll trade for Ore Chunks and 20 Scent Seeds. 
A cutting board? I'll trade for 5 Ember Seeds. 
3 Peaches I'll trade for Ore Chunks. 
10 Bombs I'll trade for Ore Chunks. 
10 Ore Chunks I'll trade for 20 Gale Seeds. 
4 Ember Seeds I'll trade for Ore Chunks. 
10 Pegasus Seeds I'll trade for Ore Chunks.  
How about it? -Sure -No 
Trading would be a waste, anyway. 
OK, pick up this Red Bomb. 
You can carry more Bombs now. Plus you get free Bombs. 
If you want something, we can trade. 
It's shiny and it has "Member's Card" on it. I don't know... I'll trade for Ore Chunks.
I traded away all my stuff. I'll have more later. Go home. 
You don't have enough to trade. 
AHH! ! ! You startled me! Winter sets in all of a sudden, then down my chimney comes... You're not Santa! You don't scare me! Now take this shovel 
and clear the snow from my walkway! Keep the shovel when you're done. 
Can you shovel my walkway? 
You cleared the snow! Thanks! You can also use that shovel 
to dig up treasure. Try it every- where you go!!!

So, Link! You've finally reached the altar! Bother! We can't have you scampering about up here! So we've dragged you in here. 
The Flames of Sorrow, Destruction and Despair burn brightly. The return of the Evil King Ganon approaches. Our sacrifice of Zelda is all that remains! When we call Ganon's spirit into the vessel, it will be done! You can't stop us! Prepare to meet your doom! 
Oh hoh hoh! I did not think you would get so far... 
But I shall not fall like Onox and Veran! See my true power! 
We'll sacrifice you so the Evil King can return! 
Hoh hoh! Ganon's return was but a step away! Link! It is not over! Our rites have failed, but by sacrificing this body, Ganon will return! And you will be destroyed! Eee hee hee hee! 
Gwoh hoh hoh... Gwah hah hah... Destroy...all... Kill ALL!!! 
Gwoh hoh hoh! I am Ganon... The Evil King... 
I've got you!

Gar har har! I am Vire, Onox's loyal henchman! I heard someone was trying to stop Onox, but it's just some kid! Fine! I can handle you! 
Gar har har har! Huh? No way! There's no way you could ever find my... ...Ah, whatever! You got brains, but how about brawn? Come on! 
OUCH! Pesky kid! Take this! 
Bully! That's it! I'm serious! 
Fine! Goodbye! 
OUCH..! I paid for my overconfidence, but I'll report this to Onox! Gar har har! 
Im...impossible! Not once, but twice..! Veran, Onox... I'm sorry... Goodbye! 
3 Large, 2 Regular. 
I want a nice tropical vacation. 
Feel my cold, steely gaze!!! 
Huh? Did I say that? 
Really? I mean, I knew that! 
I wish I could go to a tropical southern island. 
I want to ride a plane. Anywhere is fine. 
I'm so sleepy. 
Do come in! I am Vasu, the jeweler. Is this your first time? Then let me explain jewelry.
Carrying a ring does nothing. Don't forget to open the Item Screen and wear it. 
I've appraised all your rings! 
Do come in! Welcome to Vasu Jewelers. What can I do? -Appraise -List -Quit 
Which one shall I appraise? 
It's 20 Rupees! -Appraise -Quit 
You don't have enough. Sorry. 
You have this one already, so I'll buy it for 30 Rupees. 
Rings do nothing unless worn! 
I am Red Snake. And you want to ask about rings? -Yes -No 
Appraisal or Ring Boxes... Which one? <$0C><$10>Appraisal -Box 
There are many magical rings in this land, but just finding one does not give you its powers. Until a ring has been appraised and its power understood, it cannot be used. Vasu does appraisals. Once appraised, pick from the List the ones you want in your Ring Box. And remember to wear the ring you will use. That is all.
To carry appraised rings, you must have a Ring Box. Pick your rings from the List and put them in your box. Then you can open the Item Screen at any time to wear a ring. Give it a try.
Take your pick. -Fortune -Link 
Fine... Use a Game Link cable to connect to another Game Boy Color. Now check to see if your friend is ready. OK! Now for your Fortune! On "Start," I'll go see your friend. On "Ready," you both choose. Ready -Start! 
I got stuck along the way. Is your cable connected? Please check it, then try again! 
Come back anytime. 
Appraise this? -Yes -No 
No! You can't leave until I appraise it! 
I'll appraise it for free this time, but after this, it will be 20 Rupees per ring. If you get two of the same ring, I'll buy one for 30 Rupees. Now, the List! Appraised rings get added to the List. When you want a ring, move it from your List to your box. Talk to me to see your List. Let's take a peek at it now. 
Oh! All your rings have been appraised. 
Oh! You don't have any rings in your List! 
Do you want to hear more? -Yes -No 
That's what that ring is. I'll add it to your List! 
I am Red Snake! I am keeper of ring secrets! Say a secret, or ask about a secret. Make your choice! -Say -Ask -Quit 
"All About Ring Secrets." -Read -Don't 
If you save the secret the Red Snake told you in an Oracle of Ages game you played, and tell it to the Red Snake here, you can bring rings found in your Oracle of Ages game here. In the same way, you can take rings from here to your Oracle of Ages game. Good news! With a Game Link cable and two Game Boy Color systems, you can bring rings here without saving your secret! -NOTE!!- If you haven't finished your quest or used a secret to visit Holodrum, your ring secret will not work. 
Oh, really?
Hmm... I see! I call this the (Ring name)! 
Listen well! (Ring Secret) Listen again? -Yes -No 
I don't know that secret. Come back after listening again to the secret you heard in Oracle of Ages. 
I am Blue Snake. I give Ring fortunes. Would you like a ring fortune? -Yes -No 
"Ring Link Basics" -Read -Don't 
How can you do a friendship fortune by yourself? Try it with a friend. 
Your Fortune is finished. The ring represents your friendship. Do not be angry, no matter what. 
I am Blue Snake. I manage the Game Link cable. What shall I do? -Fortune -Link -Nothing 
Pick a topic. -Fortune -Link -Nothing 
About Ring Links With a Game Link cable and two Game Boy Color systems, you can bring the rings you found in an Oracle of Ages game to Holodrum without saving your secret. Insert your Oracle of Ages Game Pak into another Game Boy Color, insert a Game Link cable, and turn the power ON, but don't press any buttons. Then, play Oracle of Seasons, talk to Blue Snake and choose Link to bring rings found in Oracle of Ages to here. In the same way, you can take rings found here to an Oracle of Ages game you are playing. --NOTE!!!-- If you haven't finished this quest before or come by secret to Holodrum, you cannot link. Read more? -Yes -No 
Hmm... OK. I have brought your rings from Labrynna, so see Vasu to check your List. 
OK. Link your Game Boy Color to the other. Insert a Game Pak into the other Game Boy Color. Turn the power ON. Choose Begin when ready! -Begin! 
Which data will you use? 
I can't find Oracle of Ages data to link to! 
That file has no secrets! 
You're leaving? Come again. 
Do not remove the cable while I am working. 
Now linking! Don't remove the cable. 
The link failed! Is the Game Link cable connected? Is a Game Pak inserted in the other Game Boy Color? Is the power ON? Come back after you check that! 
Link complete! You may now remove the Game Link cable. 
Until you've had a ring appraised and its power revealed, you cannot wear it. Let's appraise it! 
Oh, my! You're amazing! 
Take this ring! 
You have slain 1000 monsters! 
You've collected 10,000 Rupees! 
You've had 100 rings appraised! Vasu appreciates your business!
You have saved the world! You are a true hero! 
Rings made from Mystical Seeds have very mystical powers. If you wear one, its mystical power will be passed to you. But you must keep it in your Ring Box. The mystical power will gradually weaken and you won't be able to use it. Understood? -Yes -No 
Oh! You don't have a Ring Box? I like you, so here! Take this Ring Box. 
What! Oh, no! 
Ring Fortunes Through a Ring Fortune you and a friend each get a ring as a sign of your friendship when you and a friend use a Game Link cable to link two Game Boy Color systems. Talk to Blue Snake after connecting your Game Boy Color systems to link. After checking your Fortune, he'll give you each a ring that suits your friendship. --Warning-- You cannot do it alone. You must do it with a Game Pak a friend has played. Read others? -Read -Don't 
Good to see you! Welcome to Vasu Jewelers. 
Take this ring as a sign of our friendship.

I'm Ruul, mayor of Horon Village. Do you have any Gasha Seeds? If you plant one in soft earth, it will grow into a tree that bears nuts! Inside those nuts, you'll find all sorts of things! It's so fun I can't help myself. 
The mayor is fascinated with Gasha Nuts now. The place, planter and the planter's deeds affect what the nut produces. The mayor found a good place recently, so he is quite happy. 
Need anything? -Yes -No 
Sorry. I'm busy. 
??? That's odd! 
Goodness! It's a message from my friend in Labrynna! Thanks so much! I'll make it so you can carry even more rings! 
And I'll teach you the secret to carrying more rings in Labrynna, too. (Secret) Did you get it? -Yes -No 
Ask me again if you forget the secret. 
Let me see your Ring Box... Huh! Yah! Hah!!! ... ... ... ... How's that? 
You don't have a Ring Box? Then I'll have to give you a box! 
This is the mayor's home. 
You don't know about Gasha Seeds??? You're missing out! I'll give you my prized Gasha Seed to welcome you to town. 
There's some soft earth just outside. Plant it there.

Deflect enemy attacks while pressing the shield button. 
There are five kinds of Mystical Seeds. They appear in different seasons, and each seed type has a unique effect. You can't carry seeds without a satchel. 
After taking a Bomb out, press the button again to place it. Press (control pad) to throw a Bomb in that direction. Press the button again to pick up a placed Bomb. 
Set items to A or B on the Subscreen. The number of items like seeds and Bombs decrease with each use, so keep track of how many you have.

Open the Sub- screen and press SELECT twice to see the Essence Screen. Next, choose Save and press A to see the Save Screen. 
Holodrum has four seasons- spring, summer fall and winter. The world changes with the seasons. In spring, blast blooms can send you high in the air, summer reveals creek beds and lake bottoms. In fall, leaves open new paths and mushrooms are ready to be picked. In winter, snow blocks trails and lakes freeze. 
Press START to access the Subscreen, then press SELECT to scroll through screens. First is the Item Screen, then the Quest Status Screen, then the Essence Screen. On the Quest Status Screen, you can pick a ring to wear. 
Umm, even this Know-It-All Bird knows little of essences. 
Return light to unlit torches! 
What you seek is in the eye. 
This is the Hero's Cave. Continue on if you trust your skills. 
You've done well to make it this far, but there is a final trial for the true hero. It costs 60 Rupees. Will you try? -Yes -No 
Open the chests in the proper order. Their locations offer a clue. Look carefully. 
Then come again. 
Even a hero has need of money. Save up, then return. 
Incredible! You have met the challenge! 
I am the master diver! To become my pupil, go to the next cave and open all four eyes in a single stroke! And bring back proof that you have done so! 
Ohh!!! That's my Master's Plaque! You've passed my test! Very well, then! I accept you as my pupil! Take these Flippers! 
Are you sure you won't be my pupil? Really? There's no way? 
This text dump was done by EvilGiegue. This line is copy protection and isn't actually in the game, of course.
I heard that Zelda was kidnapped. What are we to do? 
I'll teach you my secret route to Mt. Cucco! There's a diving hole among the reefs in town. Use the Flippers I gave you. 
You can plant a Gasha Seed. -Plant -Don't 
You got a Gasha Nut! Check what's inside! 
Inside was a Piece of Heart! Check it on the Subscreen. 
A ring was inside!
A Potion was inside!
200 Rupees were inside!
5 hearts were inside!
A fairy was inside!
This soft earth is great for planting seeds. 
Your jewels fit perfectly! 
Soil, time, sun, rain, warmth... I await one who knows many essences... 
Oh keeper of the essences! I have awaited your arrival! I give you this! 
I have nothing more to give. Be on your way! 
Oww! Sorry! Will you forgive me if I teach you something? If you are lost in the woods, travel west, south, east, then north, taking each step in a warmer season than the last. 
Welcome to Goron Mountain. It's too cold to go outside, so I'm all out of shape. 
Do you know of the Goron Vase? All collectors want to have it! 
Biggoron is so big he can't fit in our cave. But it's so cold outside... The poor Goron. 
Goron Mountain has always had winter year- round, but ever since the Temple of Seasons sank, it's gotten even colder. You can catch cold just going outside. 
Biggoron is up above, but he has a cold, so be quiet. 
Lava, huh? I hate the cold. 
If I had the Goron Vase, I wouldn't trade it for 100 Fish. 
This year is so weird. No matter how long winter is, it's never been this cold... Something is very wrong. 
Good thing Biggoron is over his cold. 
It's so nice of you to come all the way here just to see me! Since you did, shall I make it so you can carry more rings? -Yes! -No 
Then let me see your box. Do this here... That there... OK! I'm done! 
Living alone is nice, but it can get lonely... 
Mind your own business... Is that your attitude..? 
...But you don't have a Ring Box. Come back when you have one. 
Forging the great sword is a huge task. Biggoron can't even do it if he isn't feeling his best. 
The weather is back to normal, but I still hate the cold. 
Bwee... Hoom... The poor Great Moblin. Having to make Bombs here... 
Bwee... We'll overcome these troubles and create a new tomorrow! 
Bwee... My great lair is in ruins! I have to start from scratch... But why did this happen to me?!? 
Bwee... How many more Bombs will it take to rebuild our Lair? After what just happened, I've lost all hope. 
Bwee-hee! So it was you! You'll pay!!! "An eye for an eye!" 
Bwee... I'm tired... I don't know how many Bombs I've made. We should be almost done... 
When the mouth opens, attack from within. Then super- human strength will prevail. 
A guarded body watches with unguarded eyes. 
Recall the order you slay the knights in. 
A silent watch may be needed. 
The magical ice freezes all. 
The weak shall not move the blue rollers. 
I shall be your guide. 
Do not forget to give me Mystery Seeds. 
In water, it is invincible... 
The source of the curse is hidden in darkness. 
Good defense is the best offense against spikes. 
Jumping up and on will send you even higher. 
Greater speed gives greater distance. 
Icy cores make piercing blades. 
Below me, red. My right, red. Only I shall shine blue. 
Blue seeds will give you speed. 
It was so stormy that Cap'n lost the bell he got from a special someone. That's a bit o' trouble... 
That bell he got from 'is special someone was so rusty. Aye... I'd be mad, too. 
Our ship got caught in a storm and sank. When we woke, 'ere we were. Where are we? It all looks so weird. 
Isn't this the afterlife? Aye, no wonder it looks so weird! Ore rollin' all 'round... 
With the Cap'n in such a state, we'll never get the ship out! 
That bell may look rusty, but it's a fine bit o' work. 
That bloke we sent lookin' for the bell 'asn't come back. I told 'im he oughtta search the ship... 
It takes real skill to get a bell back to its original condition once it's rusted. 
'Ave you seen our ship? It's over by the graveyard. We 'aven't fixed it, so it's in terrible shape. 
Cap'n got a special someone he can't forget. What's more, she's said to be the queen of some great land. 
Is he all right? That bloke's so forgetful... 
Are we gonna be all right? We're so forgetful... 
Now how'd that go? 
Aye, that's it. Nothin'! Forget it! Ar har har! 
It's so quiet downstairs... Ev'ryone's gone? We're the only ones left??? 
Aye, I guess I'm used to life 'ere now. 
How long do they plan on staying here!?! 
Don't tell me you're gonna stay here now! 
I want to get back to all me mates and dig the ship free, but Cap'n said, "Don't come back 'til ya find me bell"! Can't someone take me place..? 
You'll look for the bell?!? Then I can go back! Thank'ee! 
Aye, aye, sir! 
Now reporting, Cap'n! The ship's all fixed! We can set sail anytime! 
Useless fools! Can't someone find me bell? Aye? You..? 
Ar, har, har! Don't be silly! You ain't an experienced adventurer yet! If you 'aven't at least proven your adventurin' skills by seein' the inside o' some ruins, I've no use for you! 
Aye, I can see it in your eyes. You're a competent adventurer... OK! Go get it! Find me bell! I'll be waitin'! 
Eh? You brought me bell? Thank'ee! Let's take a gander! 
Oh! Surely this- Ar! This thing's rusted something awful! What are you pullin'? This won't do! Go get it polished! 
Ar! There's no mistakin' it! This bell is full o' memories--but that don't mean they're all good! Sniff! Now I'm all pensive. It's not like me. 
We're off, mateys! To sea! 
Ambi??? Nay, 'tis I that must be dreamin'!!! I never thought we'd meet again after so long! 
Even now, when I think of our parting, it pains my heart. Though many years 'ave gone by since then, you are as beautiful as ever... 
Ambi... I would stay 'ere with you if I could, but...sniff! 
Oh, Ambi! 
Ar! Set sail, mateys! 
To the ship! 
What a beautiful sound, that voice! Could it be? 
Cap'n! Am I dreaming? I've been on an eye-opening journey through time, but never did I expect to meet you again, especially here! 
Nay! You are unchanged! Every bit the man you were--if not a little thin! 
You need not explain--I understand. You are a seafaring man and cannot live your life on land... So I shall be your port of call, waiting always for your return! 
Oh, Cap'n!!! 
You weren't s'posed to see me like this! 
If I'd known the secret to bein' lucky, the boat wouldn't 'ave sunk and I wouldn't 'ave been left behind. Do ya know the secret? -Yes -No 
If ya don't know, you'll meet with ill luck, too. 
Then yer a lucky bloke! Teach me! 
Thank'ee! Now I'm lucky! I'd like to give ya somethin' lucky in return... But yer luck seems to 'ave run out... What shall we do? Aye! I know! Get 777 Ore Chunks! Sounds lucky, don't it? Then I'll share my luck with ya! 
Yer Ore Chunks aren't so lucky. If ya get 777, ya'll be lucky! 
Ya've got 777 Ore Chunks! Wow! Yer so lucky! Let me give ya this lucky gift! 
I'll teach ya the secret for bringin' yer luck with ya to Labrynna. (Secret) Got that? -Yes -No 
Come ask me again if ya forget the secret. 
Why, Link! What brings you here? I asked Nayru to send me on an eye- opening journey to different lands and different ages! Traveling alone is difficult, but it is one of a queen's many roles. However... 
This Holodrum is a strange place. The seasons here are so fickle. It must surely bring hardship to the people... 
But isn't Sunken City so elegant? Perhaps I shall make my palace sunken, too! 
As I stand here watching the sea, I recall him. Yes, that seafaring man. But a a child like you wouldn't understand my feelings. 
Welcome to the Subrosian Smithy! We do the finest work in the land, but we take on only jobs that interest us! The two in back are masters of the trade. I'm just a manager. 
Hmm? The Master speaks... 
Hmm... Is that so? 
He says you hold a bell of great value. He hasn't offered to polish it, but should he? -Please -Do it! 
"Please"--?!? Is that how you ask for a favor? Try again later! 
Try again later! 
Splendid answer! Straight and to the point! 
Master! Do it now! 
Sorry for the wait! This is why he's a master! The finest work in all the land! Take it! Treat it like an heirloom! 
Treat it like an heirloom! 
So what'll it be? -Make it fine! -Do whatever. 
"Fine!"--?!? You put too much value on your belongings! Try again later! 
"Do whatever"??? Say no more! 
Master! He says do whatever! 
Has anyone told you the secret for getting your shield forged? -Yes -No 
Then tell me! 
Play dumb if you like. 
Huh? Master says, "That's wrong!" Try again later! 
Hmm... Master says, "Close enough." We'll do it! 
But... You don't have a shield! Try again later! 
The Master misses nothing! That Hard Ore could make your cheap shield amazingly fine! 
The Master's eyes cannot be deceived! 
I'll teach you the secret to taking your forged shield to Labrynna. (Secret) Got it? -Yes -No 
If you forget the secret, just ask. 
This is no place for one with no shield to come! Try again later! 
This shoots off huge fireworks! 
You did it! Cool!!! 
Thank you, Link! I knew you could save me. Now that I am free again, the seasons should return to normal! 
The trials you faced to collect the Essences of Nature have made you a true hero! A new trial shall call you away soon, but we Oracles will always watch over you in secret, in hope that darkness is kept from the hearts of mankind. 
Let us return to Horon Village and meet the others! 
Kya, ha, ha! Link! Don't think this is the end... 
Onox has fallen, but the damage he has done to this land burns on in the Flame of Destruction! When this flame lights the dark, our wish shall be granted! Hya, ha, ha, ha! 
...Link! ...Has it ended? Thank you, Link. You halted the completion of the rites that would have revived Ganon! Since they could not sacrifice me in their final rite, the powers of darkness could only revive a mindless, raging Ganon. Your power, wisdom and courage were able to prevent Twinrova's plan to resurrect Ganon. Now hope and peace can return to the hearts of the people. Thank you! You are a true hero! Let us return to the others! 
You've done it, Link! I am very proud! But are you not weary? My power shall take you back to the village! 
See, Link? I have managed to help, too. 
Princess Zelda! I am glad to see you return safely! Link! You are all I expected! I always believed in you! 
I knew you would find a way, Link! Let us dance together again! 
Welcome back, Princess Zelda! Welcome back, Link! Now all is finished! 
Link... The three (Triforce) on your left hand symbolize power, wisdom and courage-- these are the mark of the hero who is fated to appear when peace crumbles in Hyrule. With the Essences of Nature and Time and the courage you possess, you have fought back the powers of evil! The guidance of the Triforce has made you into this legendary hero! Thank you, Link. 
Oh, no!!! The castle is crumbling now that the powers of shadow wane! We must get out of here! 
! ! ! What do we do..? 
You did it, Link. I'm so proud!!! Leave this to me! 
Good luck, Link. Only you can defeat Twinrova! Surely the powers of the eight essences will aid you! 
Link! You're safe! Thanks to you, peace has come to the land of Holodrum! Look! The people are happy! Let us dance together again, Link! By the way, Impa received a letter from a homing pigeon and immediately traveled on to Labrynna in haste. It sounded as if all is not well. What could be happening in Labrynna? I have a bad feeling about it. 
Din is such a powerful dancer! Just seeing her gives one hope. 
I still haven't been that way. What's there? 
Lately the lava temperature has been dropping. 
Things haven't been right ever since that "temple" fell. 
Whoa! A "temple" fell into the East Plaza. 
My! What strange clothes! Where did you find them? 
Ahhh... It feels good! 
Ever since the "temple" fell, the lava level has dropped. Soon, we won't have any to eat! 
Ahhh... What great lava! A lava bath is the best thing after practicing the Subrosian Dance! 
The volcanoes have been acting up because of the "temple." 
You can get a lot of good Ore Chunks around here. 
You can find Ore Chunks nearby. It's my secret spot, so don't tell anyone! 
Lava Soup is so delicious! One sip of that cures any cold! 
If you dig up the ground near here, you can get Ore Chunks. Some spots produce lots of Ore Chunks! 
If you can do the Subrosian Dance well, you can get a Boomerang. 
I'm quite busy! There're lots of good Ore Chunks at the "temple" in the east. 
Having Rupees doesn't do you any good. You need Ore Chunks! 
Volcano showers feel so great! 
Diggin' around for Ore Chunks Diggin' down for more chunks
I know there's treasure around here somewhere, and I'm gonna find it! 
I smell Ore Chunks nearby... 
Rumors tell of precious Red Ore and Blue Ore. If you mix the two, you get unbelievably hard ore! But it's a secret! 
Some weird guys called Piratians have settled down south. 
Lately, Subrosia Market has begun carrying lots of weird things. I think they get it all from the "temple." 
Grab items, hit switches and stun beasts from far away... Boomerangs are so useful! 
Rosa's mystical necklace opens locked doors. Celebrities get the best toys! 
Simply divine! Impeccably fine! Gorgeous design! Notably kind! Signs!!! 
Have you broken any signs! Of course not! Who could? They're so lovely! You and I see eye to eye! 
You've broken (Number of signs broken) signs How could you be so cruel..? 
You've broken (Number of signs broken) signs You'll pay if you keep it up! 
You've broken (Number of signs broken) signs Something awful will happen if you don't quit! 
You've broken (Number of signs broken) signs That's as far as you go! No more--or else! 
You've broken (Number of signs broken) signs I warned you, but now..! How could you be so cold! Prepare yourself! You'll pay! 
Surprised? You've learned your lesson now! You won't break any more signs. Take this ring to remind you of your mistake! 
Are you treating signs properly? 
Those two were hurrying home. I wonder if they found some other weird thing... 
You! You, boy! This is the Great Moblin's realm! If you wish to get by alive, pay my toll! Hah, heh! 
Ah! You're back! Bombs away!!! 
You! You, boy! ...!!! You!?! Are you here to harass me again? But my power has grown! You'll never get inside my fortress! I shall get my revenge! Bombs away!!! 
So, the pesky kid has come! I won't let you stand up to me anymore! This time, victory will be mine! 
Hak! Hak! How could this child defeat me?!? Argh! I'll remember this! I shall get my revenge!!! 
You can't beat me this way! I cannot be defeated as long as I don't drop my Bomb behind me and start a fire! 
Oh! You have Red Ore and Blue Ore there! Shall I make Hard Ore? -Yes -No 
Oh, OK. 
Then I'll get on it right away! 
Here it goes! 
Here is your Hard Ore! It's hot, so be careful. 
I'm gonna melt ore all day! 
Let me ease your weariness. Close your eyes... 
This is the most chamber in the Temple of Seasons. Have you some errand? -Yes -No 
Then please depart. 
Ah, yes... I understand. Thank you, messenger from Labrynna. I give you this in thanks. 
Have the jeweler in Horon Village appraise it. 
Come see me whenever your quest has made you weary. 
I... I am called (Bipin and Blossom's son)
... ! ! ! ! ! ! Oops! I spoke to a stranger! 
You're Link? I'm (Bipin and Blossom's son)! No way! 
Are you strong? -Yes -No 
I'll be strong, too, so I can protect my mom and dad! 
Huh??? And it doesn't bother you?!? 
I can't wait to be a grown-up. 
I am Bipin, the expert arborist! I know plenty about trees. Now let me tell you somethin'! Blossom and I just had our first child! Yes! We did!!! Have a look! 
So, the name is decided! (Bipin and Blossom's son), it is! It's a fine name! I hope he grows to be a fine child! 
Hey, Link! My boy is ill, but still I have something to teach you. 
My boy is well, so I can rest! Today, I have more to teach! 
Hey, Link! (Bipin and Blossom's son) grows by the day, and today, I have more to teach! 
Link! It's been too long! I, too, have come to this village! It's nice to see a familiar face! 
Hey, Link! (Bipin and Blossom's son) is doing well! And I can teach you everything about trees! 
Hey, Link! (Bipin and Blossom's son) is all grown up and off on his own! I'll teach you everything about trees! 
The contents of a Gasha Nut depend on where the seed was planted. If you find a good spot, tell me! 
Inside a Gasha Nut? More than anything, you find Magic Rings, but sometimes you find Rupees or Hearts. 
I've heard that a nut's contents depend on the actions of the planter. The more he travels and the more beasts he slays, the better his nut will do! 
Finding new places to plant Gasha Seeds and finding secret stairways seems to be good for Gasha Nuts. 
And helping those in need is good for Gasha Nuts. 
Finding spots to plant Gasha Seeds is hard. Dig holes, move rocks. 
My experience holds that planting Gasha Seeds in strange spots produces more rare and unusual results! 
A traveler once told me the time it takes for a planted Gasha Seed 
to mature into a tree is related to how many monsters you slay. Could this be true? 
I am Blossom. This is my first child--A healthy baby boy! But I am having trouble choosing a name. Can you help me think of one? What would you call him? 
You would name him Link ? -Yes -Maybe not 
It's a fine name! That's what I'll call him! He seems happy to have it! Come visit us anytime. 
I hope Link will grow strong and healthy, like you. 
Yes, perhaps you should give it more thought. 
(Bipin and Blossom's son) looks a little strange. I want to take him to a doctor, but we have no Rupees... Could you please lend us some? -Yes -No 
Really? How much can you lend us? -150 -50 -10 -1 
Thank you, Link! You are a true samaritan! 
Thank you. This should be just enough. 
Thanks... I'll have to do something about the rest... 
Link! You are no rich man. Your sympathy will do fine. 
I understand... 
(Bipin and Blossom's son) has gotten better! Thank you! 
My baby never sleeps. Link, how can I get him to sleep? -Sing a song -Play with him 
I like to sing! I'll try it! 
I see! If we play, he'll get all tired out. Thank you! 
Well? Isn't he a darling baby? 
See! Link has grown! 
Link! We meet again! Do you remember naming our son, (Bipin and Blossom's son)? He's quite well! 
(Bipin and Blossom's son)is so hyperactive! Were you a hyperactive child, Link? -Yes -No 
(Bipin and Blossom's son)is very shy. What kind of child were you, Link? An energetic one? -Yes -No 
(Bipin and Blossom's son) is such a curious child. What kind of child were you, Link? An energetic one? -Yes -No 
Oh? I bet you were quite a mischievous boy. 
Quiet, perhaps? -Yes -No 
Really? You must have been cute! 
Were you weird? -Yes -No 
You were? I never would have guessed... 
I guess it's hard to sum it up in a word. 
(Bipin and Blossom's son) is so hyperactive! 
(Bipin and Blossom's son) is too shy. 
(Bipin and Blossom's son) is a strange child, but he'll be a man of great deeds! 
Link! Do you remember naming our son, (Bipin and Blossom's son)? He's grown into a fine man! 
Link! Do you remember naming our son, (Bipin and Blossom's son)? He's a master arborist, too! 
Link! Do you remember naming our son, (Bipin and Blossom's son)? He's a famed musician now! 
(Bipin and Blossom's son)... He's grown up, but he idles his (Bipin and Blossom's son)away. What am I to do? 
(Bipin and Blossom's son), my son, heard of your deeds, and is now trying to become a hero, himself. 
That child has high hopes and big dreams!!! 
(Bipin and Blossom's son)said he is writing a song about your deeds! 
(Bipin and Blossom's son)... He's grown up, but he idles his (Bipin and Blossom's son)away. What am I to do? 
My son is now a great hero, too. 
(Bipin and Blossom's son) has followed in from ipin'sfootsteps. We're so happy! 
Have you heard (Bipin and Blossom's son)'s songs? They're quite nice. 
Thank you! Now I can take him to the doctor. 
It looks like you don't have enough Rupees. 
I surrender! In return, I offer my advice! If you are lost in the woods, travel west, then south, east and north, taking each step in a warmer season. 
I surrender! In return, here's a tip! On the summit of the mountain in the east are Spring Bananas! Many people will want them! 
Greetings! It's much nicer around here since that eye- sore of a bear left. I can now do business in peace! Now then...
I surrender! In return, I offer my advice! Even if you have a key, you still need a keyhole! Foolish brother! The keyhole is on the summit! 
I surrender! In return, I offer my advice! Even if you have a keyhole, you still need a key. Moronic brother! The key is in the valley in the west. 
Thank you! 
Then be gone! 
You don't have enough Rupees! 
You already have it! 
Greetings! Let me share my wisdom! South of the floodgates is a strange vortex! It seems to be linked to another world! I offered my wisdom, so... Buy something! A Shield for 100 Rupees? OK -No thanks 
Greetings! Since you came,
Greetings! Here's a deal! 10 Ember Seeds for 20 Rupees! OK -No thanks 
Greetings! Here's a deal! 10 Bombs for 30 Rupees! OK -No thanks 
I, Link, am writing a song to praise Link, the great hero! 
My song is almost finished! Say, which is more important, love or courage? -Love -Courage 
My song is almost complete! I think you'll like it. 
Finally! My song is now finished! Will you listen? -Yes -No 
How was it? 
Really..? Come listen anytime! 
I, Link, am writing a song to praise Link, the great hero! 
Where have you been, Link? Do you remember me? It's (Bipin and Blossom's son)! Mom and Dad are doing well, too! 
Do you have a girlfriend? -Yes -No 
...Actually, I have someone I like, too, but don't tell! 
...I guess you aren't ready. 
I can't wait to grow up! 
I, Link , have decided to take the same tree-lined path as my father! 
Someday I shall fill the world with my trees! I know! You can help me! Here!!! 
With this, you can add to the greenery, too! 
Someday, I shall fill the world with my trees! 
You can ask me anything about trees. 
Mystery Seeds are funny! Sprinkle them on a cactus for a good laugh! 
Most enemies stop moving when you hit them with Pegasus Seeds, but not strong ones. 
Mystery Seeds are amazing! They can take the shock out of electrical beasts. 
I must dig holes to plant trees, but sometimes, I find Rupees! 
Have you heard of Gale Seeds? They usually bring up a twister, but you can use them to blow enemies far away, too! 
Mystery Seeds are funny! Sprinkle them on a cactus for a good laugh!

Mystery Seeds are amazing! They can take the shock out of electrical beasts. 
My name is (Bipin and Blossom's son). Isn't it groovy? 
Hey! Link! Remember me? It's (Bipin and Blossom's son)! All right! We meet again! 
Which was first, the chicken or the egg? -Chicken -Egg 
Hmm... Then how did that chicken hatch? 
Hmm... Then who laid that egg? 
I can't wait to grow up! 
My name is (Bipin and Blossom's son). I am training every day to be a hero like you, Link! 
Some day I will travel the lands and save the world's peoples, like my hero, Link! So can you give me some advice? What will make me mightier? Training daily? -Yes -No 
Natural talent? -Yes -No 
A caring heart? -Yes -No 
Hmm... It's hard, isn't it? 
I see! I have learned a lot! 
With your help, I shall be a great hero! 
Here! I give you this in thanks! 
I will continue my training!!! 
My name is (Bipin and Blossom's son)! Isn't it a cool name? Yeah, dude! 
I'm gonna save my money and go out into the world! So can you make a contribution? -Yes -No 
How much can you contribute? -100 -50 -10 -1 
You're stingy, dude. 
Thanks, dude! I'll never forget this favor! 
That's it, dude? ...Uh, thanks!!! 
It's better than nothin'! Thanks! 
You're stingy, dude! Later! 
I can't buy anything, dude! Words are worth more! 
I wonder what's happenin' out there in the world... 
Link, what's up? I've been out in the world building character! Yeah, dude! Since you gave me a donation, here!!! 
Dude, from now on we're buds! 
Did you need me? -Yes -No 
Be gone if you have no errand. 
Oh! A message from the old hag in Labrynna... In that case, take my test. If you pass, I shall give your sword new power! Will you try? -Yes -No 
I see... That's too bad. 
Then let me explain! In a moment, 12 beasts will appear. You must slay them all in 30 seconds, without being slain yourself, of course. Got it? -Yes -No 
Then begin!!! 
It took you (time)!!! 
That's too long... 
Try it again? -Yes -No 
The hag has chosen well! 
As promised, I'll give your sword new power! 
I'll teach you a secret that will give this power to your sword in Labrynna, too. (Secret)I can repeat it! Sure -No thanks 
Come back if you forget the secret. 
Are you ready to take my test? -Yes -No 
Dee-doo-doooo! Hey! Why are you in my bedroom? Are you on some errand? -Yes -No 
If not, then keep out! 
What? What? An introduction from someone in Labrynna? You seem sure of your judgment! So why not take my test? If you do well, I'll increase your strength!
I don't undertand... 
Then the exit is right there! 
Will you try it? -Yes -No 
Then let me explain. Red and Blue copies of me will appear. Pay close attention. After they vanish, I will ask you which there were more of, red or blue. Answer correctly to pass. However, there are three tests in all, so don't let passing one go to your head. You got it? -Yes -No 
Here we go! 
Now then, which were there more of, red or blue? - Red -Blue 
Wrong! Were your eyes even open? Wanna try again? -Yes -No 
That's right! Now on we go! 
That's right! That's the end of the test, and the results show that you have a sharp eye! As promised, I shall make you stronger! Have a Heart Container! 
I'll teach you a secret so you can get a Heart Container in Labrynna, too. (Secret) Got it? -Yes -No 
Come back if you forget it. Good eyes and a good memory are not the same. 
You wanted to say something? -Yes -No 
Really? My mistake... 
I can't understand you. 
Hohh... Hmm... ................ So he's doing well, huh? Thanks for the news! Say, could you do me one more favor? -Yes -No 
Oh... Come back if you change your mind. 
Can you cut all the grass in this room? ...With your Boomerang? ...In only three throws??? Can you do it? -Yes -No 
Come this way... 
OK! Go ahead. 
I'm a nice guy, so I'll give you another chance. How about it? -OK -Maybe not 
I'm waiting! 
You didn't cut all the grass! What? There's still some left. 
Yeah! You cut all the grass!!! 
Since you did me a favor, here, take this! 
I'll teach you the secret to using Bombchu in Labrynna! (Secret) Got it? -Yes -No 
Come back if you forget the secret. 
Pupil! Do you need something? -Yes -No 
Oh, my mistake.

I thought you'd do it for sure. Oh, well... 
OK. Here's how it works. 
First, go down the stairway I'm about to open. I put something way in the back. If you can get it before time runs out, you'll get a prize! OK -No thanks 
Head downstairs! 
You have 30 seconds. Ready? Set! Go! 
You took (time)! Too bad!!! Do you want to try it again? -Yes -No 
(time)!!! Way to go! 
Only my pupil could do it! Here's the prize I promised you! 
Don't forget to take it to the Jeweler in Horon Village... 
Will you take my challenge? -Yes -No 
You threw the Boomerang too many times! 
Just a second. 
I can't remember the last half of "Love the Seed," the hit secret among us Deku Scrubs. "Love, love the seed!" What's the next part? Do you know it? -Yes -No 
You're no help! Good-bye! 
Yes! Yes! That's it! It touches me everytime I hear it! In return, I'll make it so you can carry more seeds! Come back with your Seed Satchel full with all five kinds of seeds! 
Is your Seed Satchel full? Then I'll make it carry more! Hee-yah! 
And it's full of seeds! 
Now I'll teach you the secret to carrying more seeds in Labrynna. (Secret)I can repeat it! OK -No thanks 
If you forget the secret, ask! 
Don't you agree? -Yes -No 
Here's a human I understand! Let me fill your satchel for you! 
"Love, love the seed!" What a great song! 
Argh... The ship's bow is in the desert? That means... 
Ahoy! When I was searching the desert for the bell, I got caught in a sandstorm. I awoke like this! I can't go on to the afterlife... If ya pity me, help me find that bell! Me skull is rollin' out in the desert. Find that first. 
I been waitin', matey! Now let's find that bell. Carry me around. I'll tell ya if I think we're close. 
Argh! Be gentle! 
I took so long to reach the afterlife, I'm not sure I know how to... 
Pthh! I got sand in me mouth! 
That's it! No doubt about it! 
Uh-oh! That's Cap'n's bell, but I hope that'll do. It's awful rusty! ................ Well, at least I can go on to the afterlife now! The rest is up to you! 
Snf! I got water up me nose! 
Argh! Ya dropped me! 
Aye! We're off, mateys! Anchors aweigh! 
Cap'n!!! Desert, dead ahead!!! 
Hold 'er steady! To sea, mateys! 
But it's... impossible... 
Fool! It's do or die! We'll make it if we give 'er all we got! 
A-Aye, aye, sir! 'Elp us all! 
We made it, Cap'n! The sea! 
By Jolly Roger! Aye! Go, mateys! This is it!!! 
AYE, AYE, SIR!!! 
Argh! The sea is truly me home! Me heart's come alive! Aye! Sound the bell! 
Oooh... Uhhhhn... 
I don't feel so good... 
Uhwaugh! 
I been on land so long... I... I got seasick! 
Oooh... Uhhhhn... 
It's no use! Think about it! We ain't sailed since we died. 
You call your- selves pirates? Shameful fools! Getting sick the moment you set sail? It's... Oooh... Uhnn... It's no use! Put 'er ashore! 
Uhhn... Aye, aye, sir... 
Oooh... S-set anchor... 
Aye, we gotta get our sea legs. We'll rest here a bit. 
At least me ship is still at sea. I am a seafaring man, after all! 
Sittin' inside all the time made me sick! 
Why? I'm off the ship, but I'm still reelin'. 
It was too much. I can hear me body creakin'! 
Is it me, or is someone missin'? 
Uhhhn... If ya ask me, life ashore was better. 
Ahoy! Do ya remember me? Ya found the bell for me! Thank'ee! 
You keep the bell 'til we set sail again. If I give it to Cap'n, he may cry again. 
Twinrova called Onox and Veran forth from the darkness. Their mission was to send the Essences of Nature and Time into chaos, they were to hand to Twinrova the sorrow, depair and destruction of the people. But all has not ended yet. Twinrova has Zelda. Go to her, quickly! I sense a terrible evil...
The hour has come! 
Ho ho ho ho! The Flame of Despair burns! 
Thanks to Veran and Onox, the Flames of Sorrow and Destruction already flicker! And when we captured Zelda, the foolish humans gave us despair! Oh, Flames of Despair, Destruction and Sorrow, burn with the power of our evil deeds! 
Yee hee hee hee! Come! Come! Follow the light of the three flames! Emerge now from the darkest depths! Emerge Ganon, Gerudo King!!! 
I shall aid you! 
Oh, hero of the essences, do you remember Nayru, Oracle of Ages? You've beaten Onox, but Twinrova's plans have not failed! Hurry! The hour of the Evil King's return is near! 
The power of the Oracles will guide you to Princess Zelda! You must defeat Twinrova to prevent Ganon's revival! You will succeed, Link! You must... 
May the divine protection of the Triforce be with you, young hero of the Essences of Nature and Time! 
Your body is filled with a mystical power! 
Hee hee hee hee! Link... 
Know this, foolish boy! If you save Din, the world will be filled with destruction, sorrow and despair. Our great sacrifice will be offered, and the Evil King revived!!! Then people will know true pain, as darkness falls across the lands. Eee hee hee hee! Ho ho ho ho! 
All will be for naught! Ho ho ho ho! 
Are you shocked? We are Twinrova, Gerudo witches! Ho ho ho ho! 
Soon the Flame of Destruction shall burn, and when it does, no one can keep us from holding our rites! 
Despite your every effort, the Evil King shall return to spread darkness across the land! 
Eee hee hee hee! 
This is awful! Twinrova is behind Onox... Link!!! You must save Din! 
Eee hee hee hee! Despair, Link... Your struggles are fruitless! Decay, seasons! Steal the fruits of the ravaged lands of Holodrum! Raze the earth! Oh ho ho ho! 
Ho ho ho ho! The lands rot, and the Flame of Destruction burns! 
The Flames of Sorrow and Destruction are lit! Now, only the Flame of Despair remains! Eee hee hee hee! 
Our sacrifice will revive the Evil King and guide him to the light of the three flames! 
Oh ho ho ho! 
Zelda! No! 
Don't leave the refuge! Not now! 
Let go of me! I cannot stand by while the people live in fear of destruction! 
No matter how frightening it is, you must not lose hope! Hope is the one thing that can lead you to peace! 
Oh ho ho ho! Wandering about? Foolish Princess! 
Eee hee hee hee! We've found you, Princess Zelda! 
Hope for the people? We'll snuff it out! 
And you shall light the Flame of Despair! Eee hee hee hee! 
Aaaaaahhh! 
The sacrifice is in our grasp... 
When Zelda, the hope of the people, vanishes from Horon Village, this land will be stricken with despair. 
It is time! The Flames of Sorrow and Destruction and the great sacrifice are united! 
If we sacrifice Zelda, all will fall into despair... Ho ho ho ho! 
Alight, Flame of Despair! Awaken, Ganon, Evil King! Eee hee hee hee! 
The power of darkness won't let you go any further! 
The boy comes! I, Onox, General of Darkness, imprisoned Din and cast seasons into chaos. You flit before me like a fly! I'll crush you! 
Uhhnn... Don't think I've been beaten! Can you keep up this fight? 
Gwah hah hah! I was summoned from the Dark Realm by Twinrova. See my true form! Feel the might of a dark dragon! 
Gurrrgh... No... It's too late. My orders were to capture Din and deliver the destructive power of a seasonless land to Twinrova. Now, as the Flame of Destruction, that power is set to devour this land! Gah, hah, hah... 
It's too late, Link. Zelda--our sacrifice--is in our grasp. Soon no one will be able to stop the return of Ganon. Even you shall be destroyed-- by Onox! 
The Evil King Ganon returns!!! Ah, hah...Gurgh! 
Gah, hah, hah! Not bad at all! But I'm done toying with you! I will show you my true might!!! 
You need a key for this door! 
This keyhole is different! 
Huh? This block has a keyhole. 
Oof! It's heavy! 
Oof! It's heavy, like a rock! 
This block has cracks in it.
This wall is cracked. It looks like it could be broken! 
This torch needs lighting. 
Huh? This has a keyhole.

Your shield was eaten!

Wait, young traveler. I'm a wandering prophet, Sokra. Ahh...I feel it! Spring, summer, autumn, winter! The four spirits are calling you! Make no mistake! The Temple of Seasons is still hidden in this world! If you can find the temple, then pay a visit to the spirits who live there. Surely they can help. Farewell! 
If that Rod of Seasons held the powers of the it toeason Spirits, you could change the seasons! 
ZZZ... 
The seasons of Holodrum are all in disorder. Spring, summer-- what will come of it all? Even I cannot see... 
That's it! 
You have the Rod of Seasons! 
 But I see it has only the power of winter. Hmm... Swing the rod from atop that stump. Its power will be unleashed! Do you understand? -Yes -Not really 
If the Temple of Seasons has sunk into some land called Subrosia, there must be other entrances to the Subrosian land! You must find them! Perhaps you will even go to the Temple of Seasons again. So we part! 
Just as I, Sokra, predicted, the time has come when a new Power of Seasons is needed. This means you must find a doorway to the Subrosian land and go to the Temple of Seasons.
