HELLLLP!!! 
That was frightening! I was suddenly attacked... Thank you, traveler. What is your name? Link, is it? I see a (Triforce) on the back of your left hand. That is the sign of a Hyrulean hero! That must be why the beasts fled. I am Impa, nurse to Hyrule's Princess Zelda. 
I am looking for a singer named Nayru. Will you help me look, Link? I'd feel safer with you nearby. 
Zelda asked me to find a singer named Nayru. Will you help me look, Link? I'd feel safer with you nearby. 
Oh! That's it! 
This rock with the (Triforce) is a sign! 
Could you move this rock for me, Link? 
I'll... um... I'll just... 
I can't do it... 
Thank you... Now let's go. 
Where are you going!?! What are you doing? Hurry up and move this! 
Oh! Link! You saved me! To think I was possessed! 
............ That Veran lady is frightening. I was forced to do her will, in spite of myself. 
Shadows were surrounding the Oracle of Ages, so I came hoping to take her to Hyrule. I had no idea this would happen... I have failed Zelda... Zelda... She sensed an evil shadow drawing near Nayru and asked me to bring her to Hyrule 
We should not have forgotten you, the hero of Holodrum. Look what has happened now... Veran said she'd go back in time. She must be planning to use Nayru's power to launch some sort of plan in the past. Labrynna already feels the effects. If it's true, we must stop her... Uhh! My limbs feel so heavy after what Veran did. I can't move them very easily. Link... If the (Triforce) on your left hand is real, then you may be the hero who will save this world. Please help us! 
Ah, yes! Zelda entrusted this sword to me. You may use it. 
Ah, yes! Zelda entrusted this precioushield to me. Please use it. Link, can you go meet the Maku Tree in Lynna Village? The Maku Tree is the guardian of Labrynna. Surely she can help. Nayru's House is in the woods east of here. I'll be there. 
Veran said she'd go back in time. She must hope to use Nayru's powers to launch some plan in the past. Labrynna already feels the effects. Link ... First Holodrum, now Labrynna faces its doom. I am sorry to ask so much... But we can rely on no other! Please! Save Nayru! 
Link, please save Nayru! 
Could there be a hidden room somewhere? I have felt drafts from above... 
Hurry! You must save Nayru! The world is falling apart! 
Saving Nayru doesn't seem to have ended it... Leave this to me. You go back in time and put a stop to Veran's plans! 
Link!!! Wait! 
Link, I was researching the past and found something awful! Ralph is a descendant of Queen Ambi! Do you know what this means? Ralph lives now because Ambi lived in the past. If Ambi is slain, Ralph will never exist! I came to try to stop Ralph, but I couldn't! 
You're the only one who can save Ralph, and all of us, Link! 
Link! Great timing! This bird just told me that Zelda is on her way to Lynna Village! So I came to meet her, but... Oh, what a mess! A red monster appeared right before my eyes and carried Zelda off! It flew toward the tower... What am I to do? Link, Zelda is a symbol of hope for the world! If anything happens to her, all hope will be lost! You must save Zelda! Please, Link, you must find a way to save Zelda! 
Zelda!!! You're safe! I was so worried. Why did you come alone to such a dangerous place? 
Zelda must be at the top of this tower! Please, Link, you must find a way to save her! 
Link has taken it, so there's nothing to fear, right, Zelda? For now, we must hide in Nayru's House and await word from Link.
 Link... You were headed to the mountains in the north- west? I heard there's a trail west of here. Be careful. 
What will happen to the villagers? 
Zelda's antics frighten me so. Link, please save Nayru! 
Saving Nayru doesn't seem to have to been enough. Please, Link! We're counting on you! 
If Zelda were here, everything would be fine! 
Ahhh! Zelda has been kidnapped! What are we to do now? You must do something, Link! 
Link! It's terrible! 
Zelda! Oh, Zelda! Listen--just as the petrified townsfolk began to get better, Zelda and I cheered up a boy who was crying. Then suddenly lightning... 
I was worried about Nayru being alone, so I came along.

I hear an essence echoing in the Game Linkestern Woods. Can you go check it out? 
But be sure to come back.
Maybe there's something in Nayru's House that can help you! 
Maybe you can open time holes with the Harp of Ages and go back in time. 
I feel an Essence of Time on Crescent Island in the south sea!!! But be careful crossing the sea, OK? 
The Black Tower of the past is nearly complete. Terrible things will happen if you don't hurry! An essence echoes near the peak northwest of Lynna City. Can you go? 
I think there's a mountain north of Nayru's House that's related to the essences. Sorry! I just don't remember! 
Follow the Goron legend. Maybe it holds a clue. 
Is this also because Nayru was taken? 
Why do I still sense an essence near for olling Ridge..? 
I'm jealous that you'd do so much for another girl, Link, let alone the Oracle of Ages! 
Hurry to Ambi's Palace! 
...An essence? Inside a fish? 
The last essence must be hidden somewhere in Labrynna... Good luck! 
Good luck, Link! Veran is atop the Black Tower! 
The Eye of Deceit won't affect you, Link. I'm sure of it!
Ahh... Peace is nice. Now I can think only of Link. 
Ahh... 
I feel so weird. I'm vanishing! Something must be happening to me in the past! Help! 
Uhhn... It's weird... It all seems so foggy. I'm forgetting so much... 
...Oh!?! You... You're... Link! Link! 
Why are you here now? I've been waiting so long for you. Don't you remember? Hundreds of years ago? Link, you promised! 
When I grow up, I'll marry you! That's what you said, Link. Four hundred years I waited. But... 
I knew you wouldn't forget about me. Our hearts are bound across time by a thread of... 
What? That's not why you're here? Why won't you listen to me? Fine! You want to talk about Veran, right? 
Maybe Veran is using Queen Ambi to raise the tower to the heavens. If one of impure heart gains the powers of shadow... this world will be covered in darkness. That's what this is about... 
To know the past is to know the present. Veran can do as she pleases if she finds dark power in the past. All will go dark! Link! You must stop Veran and save Nayru! Must I say it again? -Yes -No 
I don't recall, but I think you need the eight Essences of Time hidden in Labrynna to beat Veran! The essences hold the power to see the truth, and they hold my memory! You won't beat Veran if you can't see the truth! 
With the flow of time disrupted, my memory is fading... 
What will we do? I'm at a loss... 
But if you find the essences, I'll remember everything! And you'll be able to stop Veran!!! Please do this, Link! 
First, I want you to go to Yoll Graveyard in the east. I hear the first essence there. 
I can't do much, but take this. 
Welcome back, Link! You've finally beaten Veran! Link, I knew you could! And I knew you'd come back... 
Welcome back, Link! Now the world is at peace! I knew you could do it, Link. And I knew you'd come back... 
But Link, Veran's still in the past, right? If she is, then can't she still create an age of darkness that would continue to the present? 
What's going on? What does it mean if they're behind Veran's deeds? 
Link, the next essence... 
That's weird! An essence is echoing from inside a fish. 
Twinrova is behind Veran?!? What did she mean by Evil King? What's going on? Link, this gives me a very bad feeling! You must stop it! 
But first, the next essence, Link! 
Link! You've collected all eight Essences of Time and know their power! Thanks to you, time flows true in me again, and I remember all I had forgotten! I'm the guardian of Nayru, Oracle of Ages, and my Maku Seed can be used only by a hero who knows the powers of the Essences of Time. The hero who knows the Essences of Time sees unwavering truth across time and space. If you can do this, Link you can stop Veran! Take this! 
Link, it's Twinrova! Twinrova... Who thought the terrible Gerudo Witch Twinrova would appear... What could her plan be... 
I'm filled with sorrow, just as Twinrova hoped! The world is doomed! Link, I shouldn't say this, but... A world of sorrow is a world doomed! 
You must stop Queen Ambi at the Black Tower and cast down Veran! Please! 
The Ember Seeds in this Seed Satchel will offer light in dark places and burn small trees from your path. 
Link, you did it! I knew you could! Leave this to me! 
Pleased to meet you, young hero. I am the Maku Tree, guardian of Labrynna. Veran, Sorceress of Shadows, has taken Nayru, the Oracle of Ages. She's disrupting the flow of time from the past. She's trying to flood this world with the power of sorrow. We cannot give in to one of impure heart. You must stop Veran--and soon--but to stop her, you'll need some- thing... 
I hear the pure sound of an essence in the Western Woods! You should go! 
I hear the pure sound of an essence in the Western Woods! You should go! 
I hear the pure sound of an essence in the Western Woods! You should go! 
Crescent Island lies beyond the sea! Perhaps someone near the town waterfront knows more! 
The Black Tower is growing! I have a very bad feeling... 
The Goron Elder has been buried alive! Link! What's an Elder? 
What? Link, you were the Goron hero?!? I had no idea. That's so cool! 
It looks like the Gorons are all having fun! I want to join them, too! 
Link... I am very happy to see you, but please hurry up and save Nayru. 
The south sea is polluted! That won't do! Go clean it up! 
You've finally come to the last essence! I'm behind you! 
Please visit me after you've grown up! I'll wait for you, no matter how long! 
Oh! My dearest! I wondered if we'd meet again! Did I help you? Veran is at the very top of the Black Tower! 
Dearest! I'll be a fine tree when I grow up! Can you wait for me? 
Oh! My dearest! I wondered if we'd meet again! Did I help you? Veran is at the very top of the Black Tower! 
I heard there's a terrible trap called the Eye of Deceit... 
It's me, the Maku Tree! I hear an Essence of Time echoing in the Western Woods! Can you go there? 
Link, are you all right? Now you can't get inside! The rock you blasted was a support stone that held up the cave. Too bad Nayru can't give us some advice... Maybe there's something in Nayru's House Gasha that can help! Why don't you go look? 
Link, that's the Harp of Ages! Maybe you can use it to open Time Portals and sail through time! The cave has crumbled in this age, but perhaps in the past you can find a way in! 
Link! I sense an Essence of Time on the south sea's Crescent Island! Find a way there from the town's coast! 
Link! You have the Echoing Howl! But things are not going well. The Black Tower is nearing completion in the past. Terrible things will happen if you don't hurry. I hear an Essence echoing from the peaks northwest of Lynnna City.Can you go? 
I am remembering more and more. The ridge north of Nayru's House must be related to the Essences. 
Link, your name has appeared in old Goron tales! Their legends tell of a great hero who saved the Gorons in their hour of need. What could this mean? 
Link! I still hear an Essence echoing near Rolling Ridge. Huh? I think someone's come! 
Link! I have great news!!! Queen Ambi just left the palace! Now is your chance! This may be your only opportunity to save Nayru!
Saving Nayru isn't enough... I'm Veran's deeds have changed the world... Link! I cannot hear the last Essence Gasha at all... But it must be somewhere in Labrynna. I'm relying on you, Link. 
Thank you, Link! You've gathered all the Essences of Time! I can create something that will aid you, Link! Please visit me after you've grown up! I'll wait for you, no matter how long! 
Link did it. 
Link did it. 
No! Noooo! LEAVE ME ALONE! 
Aaahh! Oh dear! Get them! 
Wow! You were so daring and cool! 
Th-thank you! Who are you? Link! What a nice name. I'm the Maku Tree. You were brave! They said the Oracle of Ages convinced Queen Ambi to build a Black Tower... Maybe she made them attack me. Thank you for rescuing me! I will never, ever forget it! And I promise I'll repay you when I grow up! This is about all I can do... Ah-hah! 
Dear! ...Umm... ...ahh... When I grow up, I'm going to be your bride! Ahh! I said it! 
Ohh, Link... 
Remember... I will repay you when I grow up! Be sure to come see me. 
Dearest! You did it! This is wonderful! Now peace can return to Labrynna! 
I know it is hard, but don't give up. If you maintain hope, I am sure your father will play with you like he used to. 
Thank you for rescuing me. My name is Zelda. You are Link, right? I knew it at first glance. Take this as thanks for rescuing me. 
Shall we go outside? 
I'm sorry I made you worry... But I saw it... A world filled with sorrow and despair... Withering away! 
Link, the (Triforce) on your left hand is the mark of a hero. We cannot let Veran do as she pleases! Only you can thwart Twinrova and save the world! Please, Link, chase the darkness away with your mighty hand and protect this land! 
I've caused you much trouble. But I can't stand by as the world falls into darkness. Please rescue Nayru as quickly as you can! 
The darkness has not faded yet... You must stop Veran before the darkness engulfs everything! 
I, too, ask for your help. All people, not just those of this age, will meet with great misfortune. Nayru, Impa and I will try to give strength to the people. Link, we're counting on you. 
Link, I always hope for your safe return. 
AAHHHHHH!!! 
I asked Nayru to bring me here. Impa tried to stop me, but I can't stand by alone and do nothing. 
Let me take care of the villagers. Link, you must take care of Veran and Ralph! 
Ow! Ow! Ow!!! Watch where you're goin'! You just hit Maple, the Great Witch Syrup's apprentice! Thanks to you, all the stuff fell out of my bag! The Great Witch will be mad! And I have to get that picture book. Who could have that book? Well, it's all made me mad! So I'm gonna take your stuff, too! 
You again? Thanks to you, everything in my bag flew out! You must be brave to hit Maple like this! I'll just take your stuff, too! Here goes!

Thanks... sniff It was good... Take this. It's the first one I made. Syrup never gave me any compliments on it. I'll keep this book. Sniff! 
Ouch... Watch where you're walkin'! I came through this weird tunnel and was flyin' happily along when you run into me! I'm Maple, the Great Witch Syrup's apprentice! Why does this happen to me? The Great Witch is so mean. She even took away my picture book! Doesn't anyone have that book? Now you come along and make me drop all my stuff! Anyway, it's all got me mad! I'm gonna take your stuff, too! 
Ouch... Watch where you're walkin'! I came through this weird tunnel and was flyin' happily along... What are you doin' here anyway? Well, I'm takin' your stuff, too!

Oops! I'm out of dinner fixings! Oh, well. 
Oh, my nose... 
I deed a super- strog scet to clear out by dose. 
I found this by the sea. It was next to a Tokay with no tail. Hey! You don't have a tail, either. ...Ohh. Is this... Um, take this. I... I don't need it. 
Hey! You're the one who I... Um, I'm glad you came. I was thinking maybe I should hide-- I mean maybe I should go give this back to you. Here! 
That's all I picked up, but maybe other Tokay took stuff, too. But maybe not. Maybe you should look around. 
I'm hungry! 
Ohhh-woahhh!!! 
Leave me alone! I, I don't know ...nothing? I mean, I'm innocent! I don't know whose Shovel it is!

This huge fish washed ashore! It looks fresh and tasty! 
Red fish has a very exciting flavor. 
We found this red fish. We're dying to savor its exciting flavor. 
Hey! What are those red seeds you have? Ember Seeds? What an exciting name! Will you trade Ember Seeds for our fish? -Sure -No way 
Then I guess this red fish will have to do. 
It's a deal! I can't wait to taste it! 
Crack! Munch, munch! ................ !!! 
HOT!!! HOT!!!

You've got all your items!!! 
This is our precious tree nursery. They say a Scent Tree was planted here long ago. If I had a seedling, I'd plant it here. 
Hey! Is that a Scent Seedling? Let's plant it! 
...Huh? What's wrong? It's not like it's gonna get big right away. It takes a long, long time for a seed to become a tree. Don't worry. I'll take care of it, so come back after a long, long time. 
After a long, long time, there will be a grand Scent Tree here. 
This is the Wild Tokay Museum. Did you need something? -Yes -No 
Then enjoy the exhibit. 
Hey! That's the legendary Wild Tokay secret! Now I want to bring back the Wild Tokay! Can you help? -Sure -No way 
I don't understand... 
Come back if you feel up to it. 
The Wild Tokay was a legendary ceremony here on Crescent Island. Do you know the rules? -Yes -No 
Hand meat to each Tokay that runs by on the left or right. If you give meat to all of them, you win, but if you miss even one, you fail. Understand? -Yes -No 
Then let's get started! If you do well, you'll get this! 
Too bad. Well, want to try again? -Yes -No 
Come back anytime! 
You did it! You cleared the Wild Tokay! Here! Take this! 
I'll teach you the secret to carrying more Bombs in Holodrum, too. (Secret) Come back if you forget! 
Want to play the Wild Tokay? -Yes -No 
There was a Scent Tree here long ago. If you planted a seedling now, it would take hundreds of years to grow. 
Put vine sprouts by strange walls for good luck. 
There's a spot just like this on the west side of the island. 
Our guardian is at the center of the island. When the sun climbs high into the sky, the sea comes in and you can't get to him. 
One, two, three! Is that a lot? I need to learn my numbers. 
There's a winding maze beneath this island. Maybe. 
It's said that long ago, a Tokay with no tail opened our guardian's mouth. 
This is the Wild Tokay Museum. We Tokay used to play here long ago, but not anymore. The Tokay on your left and right are real... I mean real- looking Tokay. They won't respond if you talk to them. 
I found this scrap wood by the sea. It's weird. I've been waiting here a long time, but the owner hasn't come to claim it. Umm, I guess you can have it. I've been polishing it for many years, so it's very shiny. 
If you meet the one who dropped it, you don't need to mention me! I don't need any thanks. 
Hey! You! Listen to me! It takes a long time for trees to grow. The same goes for that vine you climbed down. 
It takes a long, long time for a tree to grow. The same goes for that vine sprout. 
This is Crescent Island. I've never seen a Tokay like you. You have ears. Are you a long-eared Tokay? 
Someone finally came! This head- stone blocks my path to the afterlife. I'm actually below here, right? I'd appreciate it if you could help me out. 
You must have moved my head- stone! That means I can move on to the after- world. My heart lifts at the thought of it! Thanks! 
You came out! Since I'm moving on, I don't need this anymore. Take it! I hope you can reach the afterworld soon, too! 
This isn't good! I want to deliver the mail on time, but I can't do it if I don't know the time! 
Show him the Poe Clock? -Yes -No 
Hmm? Tick, tock? That tells time! Are you giving me this clock? Don't say a word! Of course you will! What a big help! Here's your reward. Now I'm off to work. I'm a workaholic! 
Why you... Sheesh!!! 
P-paper! Do you have any paper? 
Give him the Stationery? -Yes -No 
Yay! 
Nooooo! 
Hmm... 
Take this. 
I'm so hungry my stomach hurts.

Pardon me. I just thought you could help. 
Give him Tasty Meat? -Yes -No 
What's this? Hand it over... Food at last... Chomp, chomp ................ Why are you staring at me? Oh, you WANT something? 
How greedy! How mean! You won't leave until you get something? 
Fine. You can have this. 
It wouldn't taste any good anyway!!! 
Ahhh. I'm full. Thank you. 
I'm I can Mamamu Yan, the top breeder in town. My dog is much cuter than that dog! Much cuter! But my dog is very shy. 
Do you know of a good way to hide its face? 
Well!!! That mask!!! It fits my dog perfectly! Let me have that mask! Give her the Doggie Mask? -Yes -No

Sway right... Sway left... Move left, sway right... Move right, sway left... I'm so skinny... I wish I could change... 
I know! I'll work out! Except... I have only one Dumbbell... 
Working one arm at a time... It goes against my policy... If I can't do left and right at the same time... 
Sway left... Sway right... 
He seems to be fixated on your Dumbbell... Give him the Dumbbell? -Yes -No 
That's it... What I wanted... Now I can lift, lift, lift... I'll get all the girls now, eh... 
I'm so skinny... I can't offer you much... Umm...I know. Rrrrrip! Gotta work out! 
Get the girls... Get the girls...

My head spins! 
Wh-what?!? 
So what kinda candy's never on time??? Choco-late! Isn't that a sweet joke!

Give him the Cheesy Mustache? -Yes -No 
What a hilarious mustache! It's a riot! OK, buddy, I'm gonna teach you the funniest gag I know! OK... Here goes! 
A performer's life is no cakewalk! 
How do you like my mustache? 
How I miss the smell and sound of the sea... 
Back in my day, I was the best Zora musician. If I had an instrument, I could relive my youth. 
Give him the Sea Ukulele? -Yes -No 
That Ukulele has the spirit of the sea in it! That smell! That sound! That's good of you to respect your elders, kids! I see you're on some adventure. Well I give you something old... This is the Hero's Sword that a great hero gave my ancestors long ago! 
...What's that? It's broken..? ...Ah-Ahem! Ahh! Umm... What a great sound! 
Why do I smell the sea in here? 
Ah! What fun! I don't even want to think about any Broken Swords, you know? ...No!!! I mean, I have the power to fix anything, so I have to do it. 
What a mess... Oh! What? Do you need something? -Yes -No 
Don't call me if you don't need me. 
Oh! My dear mother is in Holodrum? That young-at- heart mother of mine is a worry! You've done so much, but can I make a request? -Yes -No 
??? Silly boy... 
Really? That's too bad... 
My precious dog has gotten lost. He's somewhere in town, so I'd like you to get him. He's so delicate. You carry him properly. There is a huge reward if you find him!

Somewhere in the woods is a tree that bears very special seeds. 
There are trees in other places that bear Mystical Seeds. 
I began my life as a fisherman on this island, but now the island drifts toward the horizon. In my grandson's day, this island will be farther west. 
My family's been fishing this island since my grandpa's day. The island is drifting to the west, so long ago it was farther east. 
We're supposed to finish tomorrow, but we're way behind schedule! We'll never make it! 
Huh? A diggin' tool? That's the spirit, sonny! Here! You can have this Shovel! Can you use the Shovel to move that dirt outta the way? 
We're workin' hard on this tower! Help us out! 
This is the entry to the tower being built to the heavens by the order of Queen Ambi. 
It's not like Queen Ambi to drive us so hard. We're so busy we don't have time to sleep! 
At first, this tower was being built to guide Queen Ambi's love safely back from the sea. But ever since Nayru came, the sun sits high in the sky as if time itself has stopped. It's not like Queen Ambi to push us so hard. In the village, they've started calling it the Black Tower. 
You can look around, but the construction has some areas closed. If you hang around too much, though, you might get yelled at. 
Why build such a huge thing..? It's just work, work, work! 
I... I'm so... tired... No sleep... just work... But we're almost done... 
This here, that there... No! That goes here! No sleep... My son's home alone... It's no use. What a horrible queen! But don't tell anyone! 
My job isn't done! How can I face the Queen? I'll never make it... 
Busy, busy, busy! If I don't hurry, the guards will come check on me! 
It's dangerous past this point. There are beasts everywhere, and you can't even find your way to the top without getting lost! What's going on? 
This is our playground! 
Won't you play hide 'n' seek? 
If you can't find the three of us, you can't go on! 
We'll hide, so try to find us! 
Ready or not, come find us! 
Dang! But there are still two more! 
You found me... But the last one is hardest! 
What? You found us all? You're good, mister! 
There are still two left! Or do you give up? 
One more! One more! 
Aww... You found us all. OK, we won't tease you anymore. We'll put the forest back in order. 
That was fun! Let's play again sometime. 
Do you quit? -Yes -No 
You won't find us next time! 
I have a strange feeling. Is something bad about to happen? 
Let's play again, mister! 
Let's play again sometime. 
Our forest will be fine! Nothing bad can happen here! 
The forest is at peace again, so come play with us! 
Maybe I'll tease you again... 
The bad guys run away when we tease them. 
Next time the forest maze will be harder! 
Mister! I found you! 
Listen! It's a mess! (item) got lost in our forest and can't get out! We were playin' a little trick... But now it'll never get out! Can you help us find it? Do you get our problem? -Yes -No 
An animal with gloves on 
A red, lizard- lookin' animal 
A big, winged, bearlike animal 
Wait, Mister! This way! 
It's deep in the woods. 
We don't even know where it is. 
We didn't mean to be such trouble. Really! 
Mister! You found it! OK. We'll take you to the edge of the forest. Yah! 
You won't get lost here! 
Sorry! We didn't mean it! But seeking is more fun than hiding! 
Really! I want to do it again! 
Next time will be harder! 
Come play with us again, OK? Goodbye! 
Hurry! I'll wait at the forest entrance south of here! 
(item) 
Umm...this leads that way, that goes... Ugh! I don't know! What's going on? 
You found my gloves, right... 
Link! Why are you here? 
I still don't get it, but you helped me out. I'm Ricky. Did you remember it? Say, do I know your name? Link? Cool! Thanks for your help, Link! Thanks a lot! I want to give you something... Hey! That's a weird flute. I know!
I still don't get it, but you helped me out, Link! You really are my best friend! I want to go adventuring with you like we did in Holodrum! I know! Take this flute! Play that flute anytime you need my help. If I hear the flute, I'll come find you! 
You want to go north, right? I'll take you! Hop in my pouch! 
Dee? Everyplace looks the same. How can Dimitri get out? 
Dee! You helped Dimitri on the island. You have good timing! 
Link! You have good timing! How did you get here? 
I'm so happy to leave! You helped me twice.
Who are you? Link? That's a weird name. But starting today, Link is my friend. Hey! Nice flute, Link! 
Out! I'm out! Thank you, Link! What a good friend! You helped me, Link, so I help Link. I learned in Holodrum-- Me and Link are unstoppable! Take this flute! Play that flute. I will come if I hear the flute. 
Go north? Get on my back. 
I'm back in the same spot. I'm so hungry. I can't move... 
Oh! You chased away ghosts... 
Link! Are you lost, too? 
Thank you for helping me out. You haven't told me your name. Please tell me. Link... That's easy to remember. First the graveyard, now this... You are always helping me out, Link. I must help you in your adventures, too, Link, so take this flute.
Thank you, Link. I thought I would never get out. You're always helping me out, Link. I must help you in your adventures, too. Maybe I can help like I did in Holodrum, so take this flute. Play that flute when you need me. I'll come if I hear it. 
You want to go north, right. OK, climb onto my back. 
Hi! Are you looking for me? -Yes -No 
Oh, really... 
That's the secret we taught to the girl from Holodrum! We'll give you some happiness, too! 
What? A new trick? 
Here's the secret to being happy in Holodrum (secret) If you forget the secret, just come ask! 
There was a loud sound far off, like something being knocked loose! 
It sounds like something heavy fell down below! 
Bwee! This is the guy Veran was talking about! Get 'im! 
What's with you? Keep clear! 
Heh heh! This guy's shocked! 
Let's shock 'im some more! 
Bwee! Why's the weirdo here! What are you lookin' at? 
We'll shock you, too! 
You heard water going out. 
You heard water coming in. 
Show your Courage, Wisdom and Power. The road to the past shall then open.

It's a podium for holding a book. 
Place the Book of Seals here? -Yes -No 
Accept our quest, hero! 
What have you brought before me? 
Mystery Seeds! Nayru desires Mystery Seeds more than anything else! She will be most pleased! By what name do you go, boy? ...Link? I offer a reward, Link. 
Bring it here... 
Link, this is your reward. Take it with great thanks. 
My palace is very large--you will not be able to find the way out alone. 
Will that boy be able to return? 
Oh... I shall be known as a great queen... Nayru, Oracle of Ages, give me an endless day, so the people can work without stopping to rest! Young and old alike will work toward my ends! 
What is this commotion?!? 
Are you truly Nayru? You seem different... You seem nice... 
Heeee! What are you doing? Catch them! Now! 
Ah hah hah hah!
The Black Tower is finally complete! Powers of darkness, come to me! 
Ahh! The powers of darkness flow through me! The powers swell! Hah! Even without the powers of young Nayru, I can stop time! Now true darkness comes! The sorrow of people shall be delivered to me, lighting my Flame of Sorrow! Ah hah hah hah! 
None can stop Veran now! You can only wait for the Flame of Sorrow to light! What a view! All humanity can feel the sorrow! Ah hah hah hah! 
Link! You are safe! I just called my knights from the palace to help since you were locked inside the tower... 
Link, thanks to you, everyone is back to normal. I thank you. 
Ralph is my grandson's grandson's ...grandson! You, too, have great courage. You shall be the pride of my people. 
How rude! I am still young! Don't call me granny! 
All is well in this age! You may return without worry. We shall never forget you. 
You must be... Ralph, of Ambi's line... Hah! I have no time for such a small fry! Be gone with you! Or do you mean to fight me? Don't make me laugh! Fool! This is the body of Ambi's, your ancestor. If you slay me, you will vanish from this world! Do you still wish to fight? 
Oh, Link! Because of my kindness, young Ralph still lives. But you still attack me! If you damage Ambi's body, Ralph will vanish. You can't intend to end your dear friend's life by your own hand! Hah hah hah hah! 
You come despite my warning? Do you not value life? Or are you a mere fool? Regardless, it won't be easy! I'll teach you your place! I'll not be as kind as before! 
Ambi's Tower will soon be complete! 
Once Ambi's Tower is done, history shall remember me as the greatest of queens! 
Link! What happened? I feel as though I've been caught in a bad dream... As if pure evil had inhabited my body... 
What? I must leave at once! I see worry in your eyes. I should have done as I was told... 
Worry not about the town. Ralph and I are here. You must focus on saving Princess Zelda. 
This is Lynna Village... Hwahhhh! Oh! Excuse me! We haven't had any nights for a few days now. 
Everyone in the village is so sleepy. 
Is it morning? Noon? Or night? I have no idea anymore. 
There's some ruckus over at Ambi's Palace. 
This is it for this world. Even my flowing tears have dried up.
Ohhh... My hope, my dreams... All is lost... 
They've taken Princess Zelda? This is the end! 
Welcome to Lynna, Village of Time! 
I used to throw myself at anything that came along until only recently... It's like a hole just opened up in my heart. 
I stopped Ralph as he went into the tower and he said, "I don't care what happens to me!" He's like the rest of us. Nothing matters anymore. 
Good morning! Good day! Good evening! Good night! Ahh! I love greetings! 
I thought nothing changed when Princess Zelda was here, but now that she's gone, it's like a hole has opened in my heart. 
The Maku Tree stands at the far end of this cave. 
My sense of time is all out of whack. I wonder why... 
Nayru, the Oracle of Ages, has returned?!? Hooray! 
Even though Nayru came back, the tower still grows! It's a bad sign. 
I sense mystical power in the Maku Tree. 
The Maku Tree has been very happy lately, hasn't she, heartbreaker! 
That joke goes against our aesthetics, ya know... 
We can't do this anymore! Off with ya!!! 
So, what's with this gloomy uncertainty, anyway? 
So, you wanna start over from scratch? 
There's no going past this point. Nothing up there is complete, so there's no entry. Now get! 
The village has it hard with the construction of Queen Ambi's tower, but ya still gotta spend time with the kids. Hey! Nice one! 
My son has gotten so good so quickly! He must be so happy since we couldn't play together for so long. Nice one!!! 
The Queen was very kind until only recently. You can ask the village elder about the Queen. He lives across the river, near the tower. 
My husband was sent to work at the Black Tower. I may never see him again. 
Bad-mouthing the Queen too much gets you sent to prison. She's so harsh lately. 
Queen Ambi seems like a different person now. She always seems nervous. 
Strange things are happening all around. 
I have to do all the things I want to before I can't move anymore! 
The Queen is nice again, just like before! 
I miss the old, peaceful days... 
Queen Ambi had a boyfriend--a seafaring man. But he set sail one day and never came back. She's building a tall tower so she can search the lands for any sign of his return. It's called Ambi's Tower. It was a touching tale... 
There are few who still call it Ambi's Tower. Now everyone calls it the Black Tower. 
I don't know if the bad one is Queen Ambi or that girl called Nayru. What do you think? 
I was smitten by Ralph's face when he thought of Nayru. He looked so romantic. 
Ralph hasn't come back... Umm, not that it matters. 
I feel better now that I know Queen Ambi isn't evil, but what will happen to Princess Zelda? 
They're building a tower on the other side of the river. 
Lately I've been making breakfast twice--on accident.
Guess what! I made lunch!
I made dinner today for the first time in a while. 
I'm so listless. I don't feel like doing anything. 
It's so hard to cook meals for morning, noon and night! 
There used to be something in back for sealing things away, but now there's just one crinkled old book. 
An intelligent beauty reading a book in a library by a tranquil sea... Isn't it a romantic scene? That's me, of course! 
The village is full of excess dirt from the tower. There's no room to walk, and any tools we could use to clear a path are being used for construction. 
All the men have been hauled off to build the tower. Only us old folk remain. 
The Oracle of Ages who wields power over time lives somewhere in this land. I wonder if she hasn't been feeling well lately. 
What will happen to this world? 
Some loudmouth named Ralph just ran into the Black Tower. 
My son returned from the tower! But then he went right back out! He's such an anxious child! 
Someone washed ashore down south. It was a very sub-rosan fellow. 
I have no hope left. All I can do is quietly await the end... 
Hmph! I guess it's not time for me to go yet! 
This is Lynna City. 
They say some animals in the wild really like people. 
I've heard there is a sea where people called Zoras live. 
Have you seen the ghost ship that sails the southern seas? 
The tower got bigger all of a sudden, and that top is so ugly. What is that thing? 
This is Lynna City. It's the city where time runs on without end! 
What did the Queen want? Puzzle Seeds? Enigma Seeds? It's a mystery to me! 
That's it! The Queen wanted them Puzzle Seeds! I bet she was happy! 
Another one?!? First, that guy with the weird hat appears, then you... Ever since that girl Nayru came, there's been all sorts o' weird goings on! 
Do you know of the Tokay? I hear there's an island full of them across the sea! 
That Nayru has tricked Queen Ambi, right? I knew it! 
Just when Nayru vanishes, the Queen herself starts acting strange! 
The Queen seems to be a totally different person. 
The Queen changed completely. It's nice that she's kind now. 
I'm gonna find something that Queen Ambi desires so I don't have to work at Ambi's Tower. 
I wonder what Queen Ambi will want next... 
They look like a happy family. I wish I could join them... 
There's been no night for many days, as if time has stopped. 
There's an odd pattern near the gate to the Maku Tree. What could it be? 
All day, everyday, it's "good morning!"
Another one was taken to work on the tower. What is going on? 
Everyone says it's bad luck to go near the tower. 
My husband gave Queen Ambi that which pleases her, but he was still taken to work on the Black Tower. I want him back. 
The Maku Tree is a talking tree! But lately she's been bothered by monsters... 
A weird person came to the village. You couldn't tell if it was a man or a woman! It was scary! 
I'm so mad! Even though the tower is done, my dad hasn't returned! 
Do you know what "my own blood" means? Ralph knows. What is it? 
I can go play wherever I like! What fun! 
What?!? Princess Zelda is gone??? 
The village has been full of rubble ever since work started on that tower! You can't get anywhere without a Shovel to clear a path! 
Ohh! How long have I worked??? Night never comes, so I can't tell. I want to go home. 
Queen Ambi has changed. She was never cruel, but now she makes us do the impossible. But you didn't hear it from me! 
It's been awful ever since that Nayru girl appeared. Now we have to work hours on end! 
Dig! Dump! Dig! 
Heave! Ho! 
What's with this village? It has no energy! 
Everyone's energy has returned! 
Hi! Do you remember me? ................ I'm Rosa! You, like, forgot we dated?!? This is my first long trip in, like, forever! And I saw some weirdo with this Shovel I had seen before, so I, like, asked if he knew you.
Then he, like, got all excited and went leapin' off somewhere. What a weirdo. 
Was that, like, your Shovel? If you don't hang on to it, it could, like, wash out to sea. 
Actually, the theme of my trip is "the independent woman," so you have to wait for another date. 
Hi, Link! The Goron Dance is all the rage in these mountains! But the Subrosian Dance is way cooler. These Gorons have a ways to go! 
That Goron Dance is way cool! I'm gonna make it popular in Subrosia, too! 
The Graceful Goron is the bomb! I'm gonna be the Graceful Subrosian! 
Thank you. You've come all the way from Hyrule, correct? Pleased to meet you. I am Nayru. I've been very worried after hearing that Labrynna would face many evil troubles. 
Link... Hah! You've done well! First you let me through the barrier, now you bring me Mystery Seeds! Such a nice boy! Taking advantage of people's kindness is too easy! This makes one less thing that can obstruct my ambitions. But my, these Mystery Seeds are unpleasant! Their sight and smell... Hmph! Anyhow! 
Queen Ambi... Now, with my powers, the flow of time is yours to command. For you, I shall create a day that never ends, so the people will never sleep, and work on the tower can continue. And when the tower reaches the heavens, you shall go down in history as the greatest queen to ever live! 
Heh heh heh heh! We are closer to the Age of Shadow! But it's still premature. The true shadow will fall when the Black Tower reaches the heavens and I climb to its highest turret! Then it will come... Heh heh heh... Hah hah hah hah! 
Huhhn... Link..? Where are we? 
Ralph!!! I'm sorry to make you worry. I'm fine now. Let us return to our own age! 
Thank you, Link! You've safely pried me from Veran's grip. Now all the strange things that happened in the land should return to normal. 
Ralph... Just like you said, I'll help in what little way I can! 
There is little else I can do, so I'll return home for now. Stop by anytime. 
Link, you have the Harp of Ages. I want you to keep it for now. I'm sure it will continue to aid you. Now let me teach you the last tune, which will unlock the true power of the Harp of Ages. 
Link... What's happening inside..? 
Link!!! I'm so glad you're safe! Thank goodness! 
Let us go! 
I am reluctant to part, but we must return to our own age! 
You won't get away so easily! 
I am Nayru, Oracle of Ages. You are holding an instrument called the Harp of Ages. I do not know you, but it is not by mere chance that you now hold that Harp. You are a hero chosen by the currents of time. Your arrival means I am not in this age any longer. I hid the should arp Gasha here, knowing this could happen. I entrust the should arpntroductionto you! By playing certain Tunes on the Harp of Ages, you can travel through time! Let me teach you the Tune of Echoes! 
If you play that Tune, you will unlock the powers of the Time Portals found across this land. Step into a Time Portal to travel through time to another age. As you journey, you may learn more Tunes that will let you travel through time more freely when you play them. Please, chosen hero, protect this land from the clutches of evil! I am counting on you, unknown hero. 
Link, please! Stop Ralph! He means to sacrifice himself for the people of this age by slaying Queen Ambi... I can't allow Ralph to make such a sacrifice! 
Impa and I will find a way to give strength to the villagers. Please, Link, save Ralph. 
I am fine. Link... You may be the only one who can stop Veran. But surely Ralph will help you. 
Link, hurry! I'm afraid Ralph may do something hasty! 
Thank you, Link, Thanks to you, Lynna City is a peaceful place once again! 
Just when we thought the shadow would wane, it grows stronger, just as Veransaid. Link! Please help Zelda! 
Link, are you all right? 
You've finally beaten Veran. Now the chaotic flows of time should return to normal. Shall we go back to the village? 
I will come to your aid! 
Time, Nature... Hero of the essences, I am Din, Oracle of Seasons. Hurry, Link! You've beaten Veran, but Twinrova's plans are not yet thwarted! The dark powers of the Evil King are growing! 
The powers of we Oracles will guide you to Princess Zelda! Cast down Twinrova and stop the Evil King Ganon's revival! Link, surely you can do it! We're counting on you! 
May the divine protection of the Triforce be with the hero of the Essences of Time and Nature! 
Link, the hero! You have overcome many trials, and gained knowledge of the Essences of Time and Nature. Only you can defeat Twinrova! 
Mystical power fills your body! 
Responsibility for Veran coming to this land falls on me, too. I will not let Ralph carry that burden alone. 
Link! How are you? Listen to me. After all that's happened, Ralph, like a changed man, has taken up the art of fighting. But I will not let him outdo me! I must fulfill my duties as the Oracle of Ages faithfully. But one thing concerns me-- Impa. This bird brought me a letter that says Impa has changed course and is headed to Holodrum... Could something terrible again be happening without my knowing? Perhaps I worry too much... 
I'm sorry, Link. Ralph is always like this when it comes to me. But I feel that something evil is approaching, just as Ralph claims... 
What's this? Green clothes... Sir, are you smitten with forest fairies? My name is Tingle, the one and only! I am a true fairy! The villagers say that at 35, I should open my eyes... But I say Tingle is the very reincarnation of a fairy! How'd you like Tingle the fairy for a friend? -Sure -No way 
Sir, you must be smitten with the forest fairies! How'd you like Tingle the fairy as a friend? -Sure -No way 
Then from today, you and Tingle are friends! Yes! Yes! As a sign of our friendship, Tingle will give you his chart that shows the way to the secret island! 
...I see! I hope you won't regret it! 
Come back here anytime you wish to see Tingle! If you get more Mystical Seeds, something good may happen! 
...These are the magic words that Tingle created myself. Don't steal them! 
What's this? Look at all the Mystical Seeds you've gathered! Tingle the fairy can make it so your satchel can carry more seeds! Shall I? -Yes -No 
Very well! Then Tingle shall work his magic. Close your eyes! 
Come back anytime you wish to see Tingle. 
Do you by chance know cooler secrets than Tingle? -Yes -No 
...I see! I guess Tingle is the coolest. 
Tingle, Tingle! Kooloo-Limpah! 
That's not cool at all!!!
What's this?!? I hate to admit it, but you're far cooler than Tingle... In exchange for teaching me that, I'll make it so you can carry more seeds! Close your eyes! 
I'll teach you the secret to carrying more seeds in Holodrum, too. (Secret) Call on me again if you forget. 
Tingle's words are the coolest! Don't steal them! 
Hoh... I'm Ricky. Usually, I can clear holes and cliffs with my patented jump...
Hoh... Link? It's been a while! Usually I'd be happy to see you... But I'm not in such a good mood right now... You see... I lost my precious gloves... 
I think I left them by the tree on the beach, but I can't seem to find them. 
Hey! My gloves! You found them! Thanks! Now I'll help you find what you're looking for! Hop into my pocket! 
Press B to punch, or build power to unleash a tornado. I can also jump small holes or cliffs. 
I guess you found what you were after... This is just between you and me, but I can't stand this guy, so I'll see you later! 
Isn't what you're looking for over there? 
If you move toward a hole, I'll just jump right over. I can clear one hole easy. Give it a try. 
A cliff like that is one leap. I'll jump if you move up to it. Try it. 
Yow! I'm sorry, but it's too hot for me in there! 
Dee! Dee! 
I was almost eaten! I'm Dimitri. I can swim in the sea.
Link! It's you! You saved me! You're a good friend. Are you going somewhere? I can give you a ride. 
We're here! You go alone now. Bye! 
I'll get lost if I go too far! 
I chomp when you press B. And I swim like a fish--even up waterfalls. You can even carry me using the Power Bracelet. 
You can carry and throw me when you use the Power Bracelet. Want to try? 
I even swim up waterfalls. Try it! 
Too hot! It's boiling hot here! You go alone, Link! 
A g-g-g-ghost! Help! 
D-don't eat me! I taste awful! 
...The ghosts are all gone! 
Did you chase them away? Thank you! I am Moosh. Maybe I can help you out. Climb onto my back. 
!!! Link??? I can help you if you like, Link. Climb onto my back. 
Tap B to hover, or hold it to charge up for a ground pound. But water is my weakness. The shallow stuff is one thing, but I can't take deep water, so be careful. 
Hold B to charge up. If you build enough power and let it go, I'll pound the ground. Try it. 
I can float if you tap B. If you move as I float, you can float across pits. Try it. 
You found what you were looking for? I'm glad I could help. See you around. 
I don't want to go too far... 
Ugh! It's hot! I can't take so much heat. I'm sorry. 
This text dump was done by EvilGiegue. This line is copy protection and isn't actually in the game, of course.
Those lazy, worthless fools! Just as we're buildin' this bridge to the Symmetry City Ruins, they go off on break! I wait and I wait, but they don't come back! 
We'll never get the bridge done at this rate! I'd go find 'em but the terrain 'round here is too rough! A man can't navigate it on his own! Pahh! What a fix! 
C'mon, buddy. Can you go find those slackers for me? -Sure -Sorry 
Then scram! Lazy kid! 
Thanks, buddy! I guess you'll be off, then! If you can get all three of those slackers back here, we can get to work on this bridge. But the terrain around here is too rough, so you can't manage it on your own. OK? -OK -What? 
If you get those three slackers back here, we'll finish this bridge. 
You ain't been over that way yet! Or are you giving up? -Yes -No 
Really! Then see ya later! 
Then keep on lookin'! 
Hah hah! They're finally here! They were just late! Well, get to work! No more breaks until the bridge is done! 
What? You're already done? I guess you fools can work! But no time for breaks now! On to the next job! 
My boss is an ornery fellow! He does no work, but complains about quality! 
He says to build a bridge to the Symmetry City Ruins, but it's not like anyone is waiting to use it. There's no rush, don'cha think? 
Ahh! It's a beautiful day! Forget work! Maybe I'll write a poem... 
Huh? The boss? But I wanted to hang out a while longer... But I can head back... 
No way! He can't think I'm skippin' out! 
Yesss, boss... 
We're done, boss! 
Have you heard of Fairy Powder? Fairy tales say it turned a cursed Queen back to her original shape. They say that Fairy Powder was kept in back long ago! I don't know if it's true or not, but it sure is romantic. 
I'm looking for a romantic poem, but I can't find anything good... How's this... "Roses are red, violets are..."

-Gold -Silver -Bronze 
I love dancing! This dance will be danced for all eternity! 
With practice, you can be a master Goron Dancer, too! 
Someday I want to teach this to my children!!! 
I dance when I'm happy and when I'm sad. If everyone did it, they'd all be happy! 
Dancing everyday tires you out. Sometimes you have to rest. It's the same as work and study. But you can't just relax all the time. 
The Goron Dance is my favorite. I want everyone to learn it! 
You gotta have both rhythm and passion! 
I love dancing! It's like every cell in your body comes alive! 
We Gorons will find our own dance someday. 
I want to spread this dance around the world! Dance is the world's common language! 
Did you know? Passion flows from inside the body when you let the rhythm take control! 
My grandpa told me this
It's good advice. 
Dance is like both sport and art. You do exercise and you express your feelings. 
You gotta have both rhythm and passion! 
The Goron Dance reminds me Subrosia's bubbling lava! 
I'm going to create a Subrosian Dance! I'll open a new page in Subrosian culture! 
Your body learns by just dancing! Only youth can push the limits of endurance! Only hot steel can be tempered! 
These Gorons have artistic sense! We must develop our own sense, too! 
This Goron Dance has hot lava- like passion! 
The Goron Dance is at the cutting edge of the dance scene! 
Dancing like this is great fun! It really gives meaning to life! 
Huh? I was diggin' a new tunnel and I ended up here! 
Hey!!! What are you doin' here? Don't you know? Games are the new fad on Rolling Ridge! You should check them out, too! 
Finding treasure is so hard! Will you let me hang on to 20 Ember Seeds and 20 Bombs? If I'm lucky and find treasure, I'll give you half. How about it? -Yes -No 
No..? Come back if you change your mind. 
Huh? Don't lie. Keep better track of how much stuff you have. 
Leave it to me! I'll find some treasure. Check back with me after a while! 
I'll be waiting! I'm sure there's treasure here! 
Thanks to you, I found some treasure! I've got two chests, so take your pick. -Left -Right 
Tell me if you think you've found some buried treasure! 
It's terrible! The Goron Elder has been buried alive under some rocks! What do we do? 
It's wonderful! The Goron Elder was unharmed! 
The Elder is buried alive! But Gorons alone can't dig him out! If we had the legendary Bomb Flower, we could blast the rocks away... 
The Elder caused such a fuss! 
Help! Hurry! The Elder will die if we don't hurry! If only we had a Bomb Flower... 
Hey! Is that one of the legendary Bomb Flowers? You can't fool me! That's the unmistakable smell of a Bomb Flower! Please! Let me have that Bomb Flower! -OK -No way 
Without that Bomb Flower, the Elder will die. Please let me have it! -OK -No way 
Thank you! Now we can save the Elder! 
I'm so relieved the Elder is OK. 
Did something happen? 
What's going on? I heard a loud noise... 
I guess the Goron Elder is buried under a pile of rocks. I hope someone can save him. 
They found a way to save the Elder. Now we can continue digging that new tunnel! 
This is the home of the Gorons. 
Huh? What's wrong, brothers? Were you worried about me? Ah ha ha ha ha! A rock that size can't hurt me! Ah ha ha ha ha! 
Did you bring us the Bomb Flower? Sorry to trouble you.
This is the shiny key I found on Northern Peak. I never found the keyhole, so I'll give this to you. 
We shall take good care of the Bomb Flowers you brought us. We shall fill the peaks with them! 
I sit here to protect the peace on Rolling Ridge. 
Do you have a passionate heart? Only proven Goron brothers may pass. Be off! 
Huh?!? That's a Brother Emblem! You understand the passion of a Goron's heart! You may pass! 
I know it's abrupt, but can you help me, brother? Protecting Rolling Ridge has given my life meaning. I need an heirloom that will teach my descendants to value life... It'd be great if you could bring me something unique. 
Yeah... A vase would be great! 
Whoaaa! That vase! What a fine Goron Vase! Please! Let me have that vase! I'll trade you some Goronade for it! OK -No thanks 
Oh... Come back if you change your mind. 
Are you ready to give me that Goron Vase? -Yes -No 
Thank you! This is great! As promised--here! 
I'm going to treasure this vase! 
I'm going to treasure the Goron Vase! 
For generations, my ancestors have sat here guarding the peace on Rolling Ridge. 
Do you have a passionate heart? Since long ago, only proven Goron brothers have been allowed to pass here. Be off!!! 
I know it's abrupt, but can you help me, brother? For generations, my ancestors have sat here guarding the peace on Rolling Ridge. I can't leave, but I'm so hungry I could starve... Can you give me some food... 
Rock Sirloin, Rock Brisket... Anything! 
Whoaaa! You have prime Rock Brisket! Please! Let me have that Rock Brisket! I'll trade my ancestors' Goron Vase for it! OK -No thanks 
I'm so hungry I could starve. I'd love some Rock Brisket... 
Are you ready to give me that Rock Brisket? -Yes -No 
Ohhh! This Rock Brisket is so delicious! Thank you! 
If you get more food, let me have it!

OK. Take this Letter of Introduction to the Graceful Goron! 
If you show that to the Graceful Goron, he'll understand. 
Really... Well, whatever!

The Elder is so full of energy. I should follow his example. 
I'm going to plant Bomb Flowers all over Rolling Ridge! 
The Elder sure is energetic... I can't keep up. 
There's a weird guy by the sea! He just floats in the air... I wonder what he's like! 
The tower seems to be getting taller... Is it just me? 
The tower IS getting taller! It's freaky! 
Look! Look! See how tall the tower got! 
Do towers just get taller on their own? 
I'm going to the tower to play again today! 
Shhh! I can't hear Nayru sing! 
No way! It's too scary! It's pitch black inside that grave beneath the tree! 
Besides... 
It might come out... 
...The ghost. 
Who are you..? Well... Welcome... to the darkness of my troubles. I'm so depressed... I want to laugh until I forget everything. Then I'd be happy. Hah............. ................ Tell him the Funny Joke? -Yes -No 
Huh... What's that..? Hah............. ................ Oh... That's so funny, I forgot to laugh. Thanks... Thanks to you, I can be as depressed as I want to be... You can take any book you want from that bookshelf... 
Hah... Only the darkness can ease my heart. I guess laughing my troubles away is just a dream deferred... 
That's enough... Like a bird I once saw, fly off somewhere. 
Heh heh! I can already read! "The Fairy Queen Who Keeps the Sea Clean"
That's my favorite story. 
Reading is fun, even if I don't understand it! 
Wahhh! My dad turned to stone! 
Playing too much may have tired me out, but I do like being able to move! 
OK! Faster this time! I'll throw it, so catch it, Dad!!! 
Didn't I get better, Dad? We can practice together every day from now on! 
Lately folk have been vanishin' and turnin' to stone without warnin'. What's happenin'? 
Is it me, or is that tower gettin' bigger? 
Hahh... I get tired so easily nowadays. Am I gettin' old? 
That tower is surely bigger, and the town is all run amuck. My body's not feelin' right neither. I guess bad things do come in spades. 
My legs feel as heavy as stone. I can't move the way I'd like... I'm sick of all this bad stuff. 
My bones feel so light lately! I won't let any whippersnappers pass me by! 
I'm lookin' at this cave thinkin' there's treasure inside, but I can't get in with this rock here. If I could just blast it away... 
I am Rafton. My dream is to make fine rafts that can sail the seas! 
If I only had rope that won't decay in water, I could make my raft. I just can't find any. There's a fellow named things<$EC> 
on the east edge of town who is working on such rope, but I don't think he's done yet. 
Hey! That's it! 
With that Cheval Rope, I could finish my raft! Let me have that rope, please! -OK -Sorry 
I guess it can't be helped. 
Thank you! Tell you what, you can be the first to ride my raft when it's done. But you'll need a chart if you want to go out to sea. Going without a chart is an invitation to disaster. I'll have the raft ready by the time you get a chart. 
Hey! What took so long? My raft is ready! Come over here! 
Shove off from over there. The raft awaits! Climb on top and press (control pad) to move! 
I'll have a raft ready for you anytime you need a ride! I am Cheval. I am researching items for use in water. 
Before I die, I want to finish my work on flippers for swimming and rope that won't decay in water. I hope to aid all the people of the world by inventing such things! 
Somehow, seeing you gives me hope for my research. 
Hey! How goes the rafting? I'm thinking of entering a raft race, but I haven't been able to find a decent oar to race with. 
Give him the Magic Oar? -Yes -No 
Whoa! That Oar! It looks like a toy... But I like it! Thanks! In exchange... I know! How's this? Lazily playing guitar while gazing at the moon is so nice. 
I guess I have to row by hand. 
Hey! Are you workin' hard? 
Welcome! This is the Eyeglass Isle Library. Long ago, Fairy Powder was kept in this very library. However, at some point in the past, someone took it away, and now none remains. 
Welcome! This is the Eyeglass Isle Library. Please feel free to browse our collection, but please be quiet for the benefit of others. 
Link!!! You fool! 
As we guessed, saving Nayru was for naught! Ambi's age is filled with cries of sorrow! Veran has extended the Dark Realm's reach, giving us what we seek-- echoing cries of sorrow! Spread, darkness! Spread, sorrow! 
Oh ho ho ho! Link, Link! Don't forget us! 
Nice to see you after so long, Link! We are Twinrova, Gerudo witches! 
You were quite busy back in Holodrum! Eee hee hee hee! 
You seem pleased to have rescued Nayru, but Ambi's age is already filled with cries of sorrow! 
By extending the reach of the Dark Realm, Veran has spread sorrow across the land. Soon, the Flame of Sorrow will ignite! Ho ho ho ho ho! 
Now only one flame remains... When the three flames burn in the darkness... The Evil King shall return! Oh ho ho ho ho! 
Eee hee hee hee! Since you seem so relaxed, I've come with news! The Black Tower has already reached the heavens!!! Oh ho ho ho ho! 
Eee hee hee hee! You're too late, Link! The Black Tower has already reached the heavens! Oh ho ho ho ho! 
Eee hee hee hee! Your might alone can't stop this! Oh ho ho ho ho! 
Eee hee hee hee! Link! Don't think it ends here! 
Behold, Veran! The troubles you caused have filled the land with cries of sorrow! It has given birth to the Flame of Sorrow, which burns brightly! When this flame brightens the darkness, our wish will be granted! Oh ho ho ho ho! 
Eee hee hee hee!
Link, Link... Your struggles seem fruitless! Behold! Time has been disrupted in Labrynna! The people have lost all joy and are filled with sorrow! Oh ho ho ho ho! 
What a waste! You're too late! 
Give up, Link! Don't you know all your efforts are for naught! 
We are the Gerudo witches, Twinrova! 
This world is ours to manipulate! No matter how much you struggle, the Dark Rites will begin soon! 
Remember our name as if it were sorrow! The name of Twinrova! Oh ho ho ho ho! 
Eee hee hee hee! Link, Link! Your struggles seem fruitless! 
And these lasses are mere bugs-- bugs before a fire! Oh ho ho ho ho! 
The Evil King's revival begins! Oh ho ho ho ho! 
 Oh ho ho ho! Onox, General of Darkness! Twinrova will not let your death go to waste! Behold, Onox! The troubles you caused now burn in the Flame of Destruction! When the Flames of Sorrow and Despair burst into flame, we will offer up the sacrifice, and the dark rites of the Gerudo will be complete! Then the Evil King shall return! 
The Flames of Sorrow and Destruction burn brightly! Only the Flame of Despair remains! Eee hee hee hee! 
When the three flames are lit, we will offer the sacrifice and complete the Dark Rites. Then the Evil King shall return! 
Oh ho ho ho ho! 
Oh ho ho ho!
Wandering about? Foolish Princess! 
Eee hee hee hee! We've found you, Princess Zelda! 
Hope for the people? We'll snuff it out! 
And you shall light the Flame of Despair! Eee hee hee hee! 
The sacrifice is in our grasp... 
When Zelda, the people's hope, vanishes, this land will be stricken with despair. 
It is time! 
Ho ho ho ho ho!
The long-awaited Flame of Despair finally burns! 
The Flames of Sorrow and Destruction have been lit by Veran and Onox! Now the loss of Zelda fills all with despair! Oh, Flames of Sorrow, Despair and Destruction, burn with the dark powers our disasters have wrought! 
Eee hee hee hee! He comes... Come now, to the three flames! Come from the darkest depths! Come, Ganon, Evil King!!! 
Eee hee hee hee! The time comes! Already the Flame of Sorrow is lit! 
Ask Troy about animals and monsters! ...Not that I don't know... Seriously! 
Deep in the woods are magical seeds and an owl statue. When the seeds are placed on the statue, it moves! The first time I saw it, it startled me, but I now find it amusing! But I'm not supposed to go into the woods, so don't tell the adults! 
Shut up! It's no good if you get scared! 
You're Hyrule's messengers, aren't you! Impa and Link, right? A bird brought message of your arrival. My name is Ralph! I am an old friend of Nayru's. We're counting on you. 
What are you doing to Nayru? I'll cut you in two if you don't let her go! 
That Veran! She couldn't touch the stone so she used you to get in here! 
I've known Nayru was the Oracle of Ages since she was a child. I have always been beside her, protecting her. 
But now this!!! NAYRU!!! 
Nayru!!! Wait! I'll save you! 
NAYRU!!! 
Link! Did you hear that? They're saying terrible things about Nayru in the village... But why? It must be Veran's work! The truth will come out once I save Nayru! Wait here! I'm going! Well, well, if it isn't Link! 
Dawdling about, as usual. What are you doing? Huh? You need an Island Chart? I've heard that weird guy has sea charts to the secret isle. Do what you want! I'm too busy trying to save Nayru to help you! See ya! 
Nayru!!! 
Is it you? Is it really Nayru? 
Sorry, Link. I was the one running around while you did the saving... But know this: I'll be the one to stop Veran!!! I won't leave the people of the past to her evil deeds! Forgetting about Veran now would be foolish. If we do, she'll just come for Nayru again! 
What was that??? I can't take this! Link! I'm going back to Ambi's age first! May fate bring us back together! Bye! 
What was that? Those hags... What are they trying to do? I can't take this! Link! I'm going back to Ambi's age first! May fate bring us back together! Bye! 
You really beat Veran, didn't you? Nice work, Link! You're amazing! ...Huh? Queen Ambi? She saw you get shut in and turned and ran. 
What? Are you gonna take on Ralph? 
Don't startle me like that! I thought Veran's tricks had gotten you! 
Link! My respect for you has grown. I thought it was over when you got locked in the tower. I never thought you'd outdo me! 
And you, Queen Ambi! Veran is gone, so now you can be my great, great, great, great, great, great... grandmother! A queen! I'm so proud! 
Link! Don't startle me! You also heard the guard on the palace was down and came to save Nayru? If anyone is gonna save her, it's me! I won't let you beat me to it! 
But it's no good entering from the front door. I know! There should be a hidden entrance in the palace garden! I'll sneak in through there! 
What? "Why do I know about the hidden passage on my first trip here?"
Never mind!!! I'm coming, Nayru!!! 
So, Link, you finally made it! I came to destroy Veran! Veran has taken control of Queen Ambi, right? Then to beat Veran... I must defeat... Queen Ambi... Umm... Well... Queen Ambi! Veran! I'll destroy the both of you! Then the people of this age, and of our age, will have peace... ...But what... will happen to me..? Umm... Link... Don't forget me. I mean, I think of you...as a friend... OK! I'm going! Ralph can do it! Goodbye, Link! 
Hey, Link! What are you doing here? I came to find an old hermit who's studying tunes on this mountain. I don't know where he is, but I bet he can offer a clue that will help save Nayru. I'll find him! Bye! 
You trickster! Fine! If I slay you, I vanish! Maybe it is terrifying... But if I must, I must. To do nothing and live just isn't me. Then it means nothing! I will destroy you! To protect the people of this age, and to protect Nayru!!! 
That voice... Link... I...couldn't do it... Heh heh. Don't I look the fool... N-Nayru... 
The Maku Tree? This is more of Veran's work! Link! You made it! Veran just leapt through this Time Portal! If we go back in time, we should be able to save Nayru and the Maku Tree! I'm coming, Nayru! 
Link! You did it! Even I thought it was over this time, but Nayru was there. She can't always remain helpless! I'm going to train so I'll be able to protect Nayru on my own! 
Hey, Link! Are you looking for something, or what? Huh? Cheval Rope? I know that name. Yeah! I've seen a grave in our own time that has that name on it. But I don't have time to chat! I'm busy! See ya! 
Hey, Link! How are you? I'm training everyday! I have to be strong enough to guard Nayru on my own! My skills have really improved! Shall we practice next time? Since you're here, we should go hear Nayru sing! 
Don't worry, Nayru! I'm here. I'll chase away any beast that comes near you! Sorry, Link, but I doubt we'll need you. 
Leave this to me and my granny! You go take care of Twinrova! 
I am Tokkey. I research time. After many years of research, I'm one step away from perfecting a tune that lets one move forward in time, but it seems I've hit a roadblock. "Echoes produce waves..." What could it mean? 
That's the Tune of Echoes! That's the tone my research lacked! It has answered my remaining questions! Now I can finish my tune! 
Ye of many tunes, I grant you a new tune! Time flows on when you play the Tune of Currents! When you play this tune, you'll immediately drift back to your own time! If you are in a place from which you cannot reach your own time, you'll return to the past. 
The currents of time run deep... 
My hearing isn't what it used to be... 
Hoh hoh! I am Troy. I am a dedicated and hardworking biologist. I've come to Rolling Ridge to study the Gorons and their games. Did you need me? -Yes -No 
You don't seem very promising. 
Interesting... My student is studying hard in Holodrum. Thank you for updating me. Let me offer you something in return... But not for free! If you score high enough in that game, you can have a gift, OK? OK -No thanks 
Are you already senile? 
Target Carts is a game in which you shoot your Seed Shooter at targets while riding in a cart. You can have my gift if you hit every target. Got it? -Yes -No 
Come talk to me after you've hit all the targets. If you don't talk to me right away, I might forget. 
Oh! Well done! You can now have your reward! 
I'll teach you the secret to using Bombchu in Holodrum, too. (Secret) Come back if you forget the secret. 
Are you ready to play? -Yes -No 
Giving up? 
Hoh hoh! I am Troy! In my younger days, I traveled the world and saw many animals. Even at my age, I'm quite dedicated! You show promise if you've come to hear me speak. Just between us, I have seen (...) 
an animal called Ricky that can jump small holes and cliffs by just moving toward them! 
an animal called Ricky that can unleash powerful punches that sometimes cause whirlwinds! 
an animal called Dimitri that eats many things--even monsters! 
an animal called Dimitri that swims very well. It swims up even mighty currents with great ease! 
an animal called Dimitri that can be lifted, carried and even thrown about! 
an animal called Moosh that can hover in the air for short spans of time! 
an animal called Moosh that can save up energy as it floats and then pound the ground with great force! 
certain kinds of Deku Scrubs that actually engage in business! They're called Business Scrubs! 
a monster called a Whisp that jinxes you when you touch it. You can't take your sword out when it happens! How frightful! 
a terrifying monster that eats shields! How frightful! 
Oww... I was injured by a rock that shot out in the eruption... If you want the Tuni Nut, go see my brother across town. 
We must do something about the eruptions! 
The closer the Black Tower gets to completion, the stranger this city gets. When the Tuni Nut broke, the city fell out of balance, and the volcano started erupting. I want to take the Tuni Nut to Patch's place... But I can't leave the city alone. This is Symmetry City! Left and right have to be in perfect balance! My brother is too hurt to move, so I can't move either. If one brother goes somewhere, the balance between left and right will be lost. But someone has to go... 
Hey! You can ignore the rules and leave the city! Can you take the Tuni Nut to Patch? -Yes -No 
Really? Thank you! I'll leave this to you! Patch lives at the top of Restoration Wall to the south! After you get the Tuni Nut fixed, take it to the house in the middle of the city and place it on the pedestal. 
I just thought I'd ask... 
Patch lives at the top of Restoration Wall. Thanks a lot! 
Hey! The Tuni Nut is fixed! Go place it on the pedestal in the Middle House! 
Balance has returned to the city! Thank you! 
Dang! If only Patch would come at times like this. 
What a mess... Do I have to be smaller? 
Help! Help! The Tuni Nut is broken! What? Will you listen to my problem? -Yes -No 
The closer the Black Tower gets to completion, the stranger this city gets. When the Tuni Nut broke, the city fell out of balance, and the volcano started erupting. The Tuni Nut is the city's symbol. We dutifully worshipped this nut. The rules of Symmetry City require that left and right be in perfect balance! But the Tuni Nut at the center of the city is broken! Symmetry City is all out of balance. If we don't get the Tuni Nut fixed and put back, Symmetry City will be destroyed by the eruptions. Do you understand? -Yes -No 
I've given the broken Tuni Nut to my husband, but he can't climb Restoration Wall. 
What? Why not? 
Weren't you listening? Then I'll explain it again! A guru named Patch lives at the top of Restoration Wall. I think he can fix the broken Tuni Nut, but I could never climb that wall. 
That's the Tuni Nut, but it's broken right now. Take it to Patch, the repair guru. 
The Tuni Nut is fixed! Can you place it on that pedestal? 
Now the volcano should calm down! I have to get that cave cleaned! 
Welcome to the sea!! Perfect balance is the law of the land! 
Sometimes I hear music flowing down from the mountaintop, but I wonder why. 
Huh? The cave entrance? It was covered by lava from the volcano long ago! Maybe if the volcano calms down, you may be able to get in. 
Having something in the middle feels so right! 
What a mess... Do I have to be bigger? 
Welcome to the sea!! Did you need something? -Yes -No 
It's nice to not need anything, isn't it? 
Amazing! I didn't know that others knew the strengths of Symmetry! Thank you for telling me! In thanks, I'll increase the number of rings you can carry! 
So, what do you really want? 
Let me see your Ring Box for a second! ................ A nut for a jar of tuna! 
Here you go! 
Hey! You don't have a Ring Box. OK, you can have my box! 
I'll teach you the secret for carrying many rings in Holodrum, too! (Secret) Come back if you forget it. 
This volcano had a secret cave in it, but that's a secret. 
Having something in the middle feels so right! 
Hit targets, win fabulous prizes! 350 pts & up: Ring 250 - 349 pts: Gasha Seed 150 - 249 pts: 30 Rupees 50 - 149 pts: 1 Heart Under 50 pts... Nothing

I shall entrust my invention only to one with both might and light feet. Cheval 
One with no wings is no match for me! 
My mighty sword and mighty shield shall crush you! 
NO! My mighty sword is broken... You'll pay for this!!! 
As long as I'm underground, your attacks don't scare me! 
So, Link! You've finally reached the altar! Bother! We can't have you scampering about up here! So we've dragged you in here. 
The Flames of Sorrow, Destruction and Despair burn brightly. The return of the Evil King Ganon approaches. The Holy Sacrifice, Zelda, is all that remains! When we call Ganon's spirit into the vessel, it will be done! You can't stop us! Prepare to meet your doom! 
Oh hoh hoh! I did not think you would get so far... 
But I shall not fall like Onox and Veran! See my true power! 
We'll sacrifice you so the Evil King can return! 
Hoh hoh! Ganon's return was but a step away! Link! It is not over! Our rites have failed, but by sacrificing this body, Ganon will return! 
Gwoh hoh hoh! Gwah hah hah... Destroy...all... Kill ALL!!! 
Gwoh hoh hoh! I am the Evil King, Ganon... 
Gwoh hoh hoh! 
I am Vire, Veran's loyal henchman! I heard someone was trying to stop Veran, so I came here. But it's just some kid! Fine! I can handle you! 
I'm amazed you've come so far. I thought you a harmless turtle, but I miscalculated. ...At any rate, I'll finish this soon!!! 
OUCH! Pesky kid! Take this! 
Bully! That's it! I'm serious! 
Fine! Goodbye! 
OUCH..! I paid for my overconfidence, but I'll report this to Veran! Gar har har! 
Im...impossible! Not once, but twice! Veran... Onox 
... I'm sorry... Goodbye! 
Who enters my fine keep so impertinently? Hah! I got it! You've come to steal the Bomb Flowers I'm collecting, haven't you? It won't happen, you pilfering thief! Don't think I'll let you out alive! 
Hey! You're that meddling boy! Well, this time things won't go the way they did in Holodrum! I've gone to great trouble using the Bomb Flowers I stole from the Gorons! Taste my Bombs! C'mon, fool! 
Noooooo! It can't be! Why meeeeeee?!? 
3 Large, 2 Regular. 
I want a nice tropical vacation. 
Feel my cold, steely gaze!!! 
Huh? Did I say that? 
Really? I mean, I knew that! 
I wish I could go to a tropical southern island. 
I want to ride a plane. Anywhere's fine. 
I'm so sleepy. 
It's time for our little game! I break apart. If you can force me back together and blow me away, it ends! But before you do, I shall take a bit of your soul!!! Now begin! 
A turtle works faster than you!
You're too late! Link 
... You did me a favor in Holodrum! I've taken the princess you're looking for! If you think you can save her, try! Gar har har har! 
If you can dodge my attacks and make it up here, you can have your precious princess back! But it'll never happen! Gar har har har! 
Ahh! Don't think this is over! Gar har har har! Goodbye! 
Not bad! But as long as I am in Nayru's body, you cannot harm me, which means I'm invincible! Hah hah hah hah! 
Hya hya hya! You cannot see who I am, for I am your shadow! 
Do come in! I am Vasu, the jeweler. Is this your first time? Then let me explain jewelry. Carrying a ring does nothing. Don't forget to open the Item Screen and wear it. 
I've appraised all your rings! 
Do come in! Welcome to VasuJewelers. What can I do? Appraise List Quit 
Which one shall I appraise? 
It's 20 Rupees! Appraise Quit 
You don't have enough. Sorry. 
You have this one already, so I'll buy it for 30 Rupees. 
Rings do nothing unless worn! 
I am Red Snake. And you want to ask about rings? -Yes -No 
Appraisal or Ring Boxes... Which one? Appraisal Box 
There are many magical rings in this land, but just finding one does not give you its powers. Until a ring has been appraised and its power understood, it cannot be used. Vasu does appraisals. Once appraised, pick from the List the ones you want in your Ring Box. And remember to wear the ring you will use. That is all. That is all. To carry appraised rings, you must have a Ring Box. Pick your rings from the List and put them in your box. Then you can open the Item Screen at any time to wear a ring. Give it a try. Take your pick. -Fortune -Link 
Fine... Use a Game Link cable to connect to another Game Boy Color. Now check to see if your friend is ready. OK! Now for your Fortune! On "Start," I'll go see your friend. On "Ready," you both choose. Ready -Start! 
I got stuck along the way. Is your cable connected? Please check it, then try again! 
Come back anytime. 
Appraise this? -Yes -No 
No! You can't leave until I appraise it! 
I'll appraise it for free this time, but after this, it will be 20 Rupees per ring. If you get two of the same ring, I'll buy one for 30 Rupees. Now, the List! Appraised rings get added to the List. When you want a ring, move it from your List to your box. Talk to me to see your List. Let's take a peek at it now. 
Oh! All your rings have been appraised. 
Oh! You don't have any rings in your List! 
Do you want to hear more? -Yes -No 
That's what that ring is. I'll add it to your List! 
I am Red Snake! I am keeper of ring secrets! Make a choice! Say Ask secret -Quit

You can't get through due to the rock slide. In times like this, I just sleep and wait. Long ago, there were many rock slides here that caused a lot of trouble. 
You did a good job finding my hiding place. 
A young boy brought Bomb Flowers to Rolling Ridge. Thanks to him, Bomb Flowers are now the product that makes Rolling Ridge famous. 
With the new tunnel complete, we've got new dwellings! Some Gorons have even opened new shops. You should check it out! 
Have you been to the Goron shops? Once isn't enough! You have to go at least two or three times to each! 
These stairs go to the base of Rolling Ridge. 
Gorons have always taken care of their brothers, and they always will! 
When my grandpa was younger, he ran a different shop before he opened Target Carts. 
I got all kinds of prizes at the gaming shops today! 
That's some racket coming up from down below. Did something happen? 
So the Elder was all right? That's good! 
We Gorons love games! There are plenty of places to play around here! 
The Graceful Goron downstairs was bragging about how he found a beautiful key in a waterfall grotto. I'm so jealous. 
I can dance carefree because the world is so peaceful! 
The target range is almost as popular as dancing is! 
The other day, I broke the record at Target Carts! 
Ever since that big pig--the Great Moblin-- came, we haven't been able to grow the Gorons' famed Bomb Flowers. 
Is the Great Moblin gone? Now we can grow Bomb Flowers without a care in the world! 
Bomb Flowers grow slowly over a long period of time. 
Some weird building suddenly appeared here on Rolling Ridge! Some guy called the Great Moblin built it, but it's in our way! 
Did you destroy the Great Moblin's Keep? Thank you! Now we can go see the Gorons who live on the eastern peak! 
I want to go get rid of the Great Moblin, but I can't roll fast enough to get there... Long ago on top of this ridge, there was a tree that had seeds that made you go fast. Even a Goron could roll at great speeds! 
Hey! I just noticed the Great Moblin is gone from Rolling Ridge. I never should have worried. 
We Gorons have many mystical items! If you get any, take good care of them. 
Are you hanging on tight to your Brother Emblem? You must take good care of it, no matter what. 
Hey, brother! Are you dancing well today, too? 
You humans are looking stranger every day. What happened? 
I'm gonna make this place more livable and fill it with Gorons! 
There's a big waterfall here on Rolling Ridge. You should see it at least once. 
I've heard there's a cure for the Goron cold. It's called Lava Soup. I'd like to try it once. 
Rolling Ridge is in an uproar now with the Great Moblin here. 
Rolling Ridge is back to its calm ways now that the Great Moblin is gone. 
There's said to be a Goron called Biggoron who's as big as a mountain, but he lives some- where other than Rolling Ridge. I'd like to meet him. 
In places east of here, the Goron Dance is all the rage! If you can't dance well, you won't make friends. 
The Goron Dance! It's gonna be a world-wide hit! 
Gorons have always loved games and they always will! You gotta save time to have fun! 
The Graceful Goron dances in the back! He's so cool! 
The Goron Dance gives form to the passionate hearts of Gorons. I'm going to master it someday. 
I'm aiming to be the second generation things! Goron! 
Who are these hood-wearing folk? They've been asking all about the Goron Dance. 
I don't know who you are or where you're from, but thank you for getting rid of the Great Moblin. That wretch was keeping us from growing Bomb Flowers. Now we can grow Bomb Flowers without any worries! Take one as a sign of our thanks. 
Now that I think about it, long ago a young boy saved the Goron Elder... Maybe you can be like that boy! We won't get pushed around the next time a guy like the Great Moblin comes around! Thanks! 
Oh! You're that boy from the other day! Who'd have thought I'd see you here! I'm thinking up secrets for us Gorons. Do you know any? -Yes -No 
Oh. Oh, well. 
Hey! That's a great one! From now on, that secret will live in the hearts of all Gorons! In thanks, I'll give you the great Biggoron's Sword! However!!! I must test you to see if you can use this sword, OK? -OK -I'll pass 
You have to, right? 
Huh? You don't need Biggoron's Sword? 
Here's the test: Use Biggoron's Sword to hit the targets! Do you know the rules? -Yes -No 
Then let me explain. Use your sword to hit the balls at the targets. Try to get as many points as you can. You'll get 10 balls. The targets are: Fairy 100 pts Blue 30 pts Red -10 pts Imp -50 pts Got it? -Yes -No 
OK! If you can get at least 300 points, that sword is yours. Ready? Begin! 
Hmm... Maybe you were too quick. Wanna try again? -Yes -No 
Come back after you practice. 
Well done! As promised, Biggoron's Sword is yours! 
I'll teach you the secret to using Biggoron's Sword in Labrynna, too!
(Secret) Come back if you forget the secret! 
Did you come to take my test? -Yes -No 
What? You don't need the feared Biggoron's Sword? 
Here's the secret to using Biggoron's Sword in Labrynna, too:
(Secret) Don't forget it! 
That was too early! 
Too late! You're off tempo! 
Wrong move! 
I can see your destiny... Goron spirits, show me all! Oh, my!!! 
I see you in the distant future. You're traveling across a plain you do not know! 
I see you crossing the currents of time as you explore a vast maze! 
I see you dancing feverishly with the Graceful Goron! 
I see you swinging your sword at a barrage of flying balls! 
I see you in the distant future. You are giving an energizing drink to a sleepy Goron! 
I see you giving a strange vase to a Goron in search of a rare item! 
I see you in the distant future. You're giving food to a hungry Goron! 
I see you in the distant future. You are riding in a strange vehicle and shooting things around! 
I see you dancing feverishly! 
I see you giving something hot to a friend of the Graceful Goron! 
I see you in the distant future. You're dodging bombs that fall all around you! 
I can see your destiny... Goron spirits, show me all! Amazing!
I see you traveling across a plain you do not know! 
I see you crossing the currents of time as you explore a vast maze! 
I see you in the distant past. You're dancing feverishly with the Graceful Goron! 
I see you in the distant past. You're swinging your sword at a barrage of incoming balls!

Lynna City! Nayru's House! Zelda comes! Zelda comes! 
Please! Please! 
This is the Eyeglass Isle Library. Fairy Powder is said to be stored in back, but I've yet to see it. 
This is the Eyeglass Isle Library. The Fairy Powder is gone, but I'm just glad the seas are clean. 
Those who have seen a strange beast on the isle to the west say the beast is always there, never attacks, and just stares as if asking for help. Some even claim it speaks. It's nonsense! 
The strange beast was the Fairy Queen. No matter how nonsensical a story sounds, it may have some truth hidden deep inside. 
The Fairy Queen used to live on the island west of here, but she vanished recently... Surely the Fairy Queen could do something for these seas... 
You're the one who saved the Fairy Queen? Then you're the hero who saved the Zora Seas. 
Fairy Powder is locked away in back, but with- out another Book of Seals, no one can reach the powder. By the way, what is Fairy Powder? 
I never thought one who could solve the riddle would come... From whence did you bring the missing Book of Seals? 
This is the Book of Seals. It was once part of a set, but now only this one remains. How they were used is an eternal puzzle. 
You say you can solve the riddle of this book? Hoh hoh! This should be interesting! I give to you the Book of Seals! 
Did you solve the riddle? 
You have done well to make it so far. I acknowledge your courage and offer you this. 
Continue on without fear. Do not forget your courage. 
I no longer have that which you seek. Return. 
You've solved the riddle. Have you some errand? -Yes -No 
Then be off! 
Why do you know that secret? That secret is only for this takeibrary. Do not tell anyone. I offer this for your silence! 
This is the secret to the shield in Holodrum, too: (Secret) Come back if you forget the secret! Don't let the secret out! 
I thank you for paying to fix my door. 
Don't do it again. 
...I'd like to say that, but I cannot take what you do not have.
Shh! Don't tell! 
I have nothing more for you. 
Th-the pain! This is the end for me... To think the prosperous royal family could fade in a generation... The pain... 
Give him the Magic Potion? -Yes -No 
Is this Magic Potion? Hmm... It looks very suspect, but if I am to die, it can't hurt to drink it! 
Glug, glug, ahh! 
Eww! It's awful! But it flows through me! The royal line is saved! Who are you? Well, thank you, Link! The filthy water that flowed in from the east lately must have made me ill. I will never forget you!
What do you wish for, Link? Huh? A big fish? Do you mean... Jabu-Jabu? But Jabu-Jabu is the guardian of us Zoras! Calling him a fish is an insult! Watch your language! 
Filthy water has been flowing in from the east lately. Perhaps that is what made me ill. Anyhow, I'll never forget your deeds! 
You have even given us clean seas again! I must thank you once more! What? You wish to enter Jabu-Jabu? I wish I could tell you to do as you please, but Jabu-Jabu is still young. He's too small to go inside him. You'd better give up. 
Link! The savior of the Zora Seas! I thank you on behalf of all Zoras! 
Great healer! What do you ask? You wish to enter Jabu-Jabu? My permission is needed to enter Jabu-Jabu, but I can't permit just anyone to see our guardian. Anyhow, the filthy seawater has left Jabu- Jabu near death. If you say you must, then find a way to get rid of this filthy seawater and save Jabu-Jabu. Will you accept this quest? -Yes -No 
Is that so... Then nothing can be done. 
Very well! Then take this! 
This is the key to Eyeglass Isle Library east of here. It is an ancient Library, so I do not know if this key still works, but perhaps you can research why the seawater is so filthy. I trust you to save Jabu-Jabu. 
Thanks to you, our seawater is clean again, and Jabu-Jabu's health has returned. All is well. I never go back on my word. I dub you Zora Hero and permit you to enter Jabu-Jabu. You may go see Jabu-Jabu. 
You are the hero who saved the Zora Seas. I offer you thanks on behalf of all Zoras. 
King Zora has no successor. If his illness continues and he passes on, we Zoras will lose our last king. 
Thanks to you, King Zora is all better! The royal line is secure! 
You want to go inside Jabu-Jabu?!? But Jabu-Jabu is just a baby! You can't fit inside him! 
That stairway leads to the throne room. The king is ill. If you must see him, make it brief. 
That stairway leads to the throne room. Please watch your manners when speaking to the king. 
Our ruler, King Zora, suddenly fell ill... We've done all that we can, but his condition does not change. 
Link ! This is King Zora's palace. 
King Zora's face looks so pained, doesn't it? 
Thank you so much for what you did! You gave King Zora his life! 
The Zora Seas are once again sparkling clean! This, too, is thanks to you, Link. 
We believe we need a special medicine called a Magic Potion to cure King Zora's illness. Where can we find a magician to create such a potion? 
Well, well, Link! 
This was the palace of our ruler, King Zora, but long ago the king fell ill. Ever since, we've continued on with no king. That which the king looked after... The key to the Eyeglass Isle Library--it's been lost. 
The king looked after the key to the Eyeglass Isle Library far to the east. 
King Zora will only permit a great hero to enter Jabu-Jabu. 
Did you get that "essence" all right? That's as expected from one dubbed hero by King Zora. 
That stairway leads to the throne room. Watch your manners while before the king. 
Welcome, traveler. This is the palace of the great King Zora. 
Well, well! Link! This is King Zora's palace. 
Our ruler, King Zora, sits in the rear. Take care not to be discourteous. 
The king is a very open Zora. Feel free to speak to him about anything. 
Our seas are clean once again thanks to you. The king is most pleased! 
You have done so much for us! Our seas are clean and all is well! I offer you our symbol of heroism-- the Zora Scale! 
The seas beyond here swallow up all who venture into them--the has ea of Storms! I can't allow a child like you to pass! 
The Zora Scale? So you're Link! You may pass! I know not what lies beyond, and I ask not why you must pass. Fare you well! 
I am studying the cause of the filthy seawater. It seems to have suddenly become polluted hundreds of years ago, but I have learned nothing more... 
I am going to study here a while longer to aid in the development of Zora society. 
Do you need me, great mermaid? -Yes -No 
I see... 
Oh! A secret from the Zora I sent to Holodrum to find us a new domain! You have done well! Thank you. For your reward... Yes! Lend me your Sword! I shall sharpen it! 
Do you mean to cheat me? 
I'll teach you the secret to sharpening your sword in Holodrum, too! (Secret) Come back if you forget my secret. 
The seas are filthy--koff! Koff! I can't swim in peace. 
Ha-ha! The seas are clean! I can swim in peace again! 
Take care not to be rude! 
The seas are back to normal! King Zora is all better, too! All is good! 
Don't think us noble sea Zoras the same as those savage, vulgar river Zoras! 
You're in the wrong place if you want to complain about being attacked by a river Zora. 
There's a large Library east of King Zora's palace. 
King Zora's Palace is beyond here. 
The seas are sparkling clean! King Zora will be so pleased! 
Jabu-Jabu resides beyond here. It's said to be quite a maze inside his belly. 
We must take care around Jabu-Jabu! He can even swallow us! 
Isn't there anyone who we can entrust the Zora's symbol of heroism to? The symbol-- the Zora Scale-- is a powerful sea charm... 
Link! Hero of the Zoras! 
We don't get many mermaids visiting us! This is Zora Village! 
Welcome, young mermaid! This is Zora Village! 
You can plant a Gasha Seed. -Plant Don't 
You got a Gasha Nut! Check what's inside!
Inside was a Piece of Heart! Check it on the Subscreen. 
A ring was inside!
A Potion was inside!
200 Rupees were inside!
5 hearts were inside!
A fairy was inside!
This soft earth is great for planting seeds. 
Sailin' the seas is every man's dream! It was great to so gallantly sail off to me dreams... OK -No thanks
Ahoy! It's been a long time! I didn't expect to meet you 'ere! We've come all the way back from Olodrum... But we got stuck in this Sea o' Storms and can't get out! Har! Ye've got the Zora's Scale sea charm! Aye, that could calm this Sea o' Storms! 'Ow about you give me that Zora's Scale! -OK -Sorry 
Thank'ee! Yer a good man! Ahoy, mateys! 
We're off to Olodrum, the land o' seasons! 
See the spirit o' a seafarin' man! 
Thank'ee! Now we can escape these seas! Take this as a sign o' me thanks! It's the jewel called the Tokay Eyeball! It's said to be the thing that opens the way to the where ncient tomb. I don't know if it's true or not, though. 
Aye, aye, sir! 
'Ow long have we been adrift? 
Cap'n isn't thinkin' about a thing. 
Tales tell of giant ruins out east in the Sea o' No Return. 
If ye go to the ruins out east, ye can never return. 
Ye've really 'elped us out. Aye, we found that Tokay Eyeball on the sea. Maybe ye should 'ead that way? We're off, now! Ahoy, mateys! Aye, aye, sir! 
The eye socket is hollowed out, but what could go there..? 
I am Plen, the mayor here in Lynna City. Did you need me for something? -Yes -No 
I see... 
It's from the oddly dressed out-of-towner. Thank you for your kindness. Please accept this. 
What's that? 
Remember--it needs appraisal. 
I am Adlar. For fifty years, I was a palace advisor, but I have since been chased from the palace and am now retired. I have known the Queen since she was young. She always held the people foremost in her heart. But since she took that girl Nayru in, she has changed completely... She quit listening to my advice... It was that girl who suggested I be banished, but... 
Just who is this Nayru..? I can only see her as a monster in human guise. I wonder if the Queen is all right... 
I thought Nayru had gone, but now it seems something is wrong with the Queen. She gives me that same evil feeling Nayru used to. It's like the Queen is now the beast in human guise... I hope the Queen is all right... 
The Queen is back to her kind old self. That's good and well, but she says she's going on an eye-opening journey to other lands. ...I hope she'll be all right... 
I am Plen, the mayor here in Lynna City. Lynna has a long history reaching back hundreds of years. Back then, it was Lynna Village -- not a city. 
I am Plen, the mayor here in Lynna City. Long ago, Queen Ambi, who ruled these lands, suddenly changed into a cruel and heartless person. Our records say it was because a girl who served her was taken away by something. I wonder... What really happened? 
Huh? It seems the Queen did not return to the palace. Maybe something happened at the tower. 
What's going on? My grandson has turned to stone! How??? Why??? Wake up! Call me Gramma again... 
Seeing my healthy grandson keeps me healthy! 
Bring all to me. 
Good defense is the best offense against spikes. 
Paths open when ancient words are mastered. 
With the blue wing, soar over the colored heights. 
Time's flow can change the land. 
Do not forget to feed me Mystery Seeds. 
The red face fears smoke. 
Scents seduce savage beasts. 
Beware deep waters. 
Open your ears to the sound of a sword against the wall. 
Test your luck. 
Stone soldiers do not fear swords. 
The four crystals tie it all together. 
Truth glares at your back. 
Greater speed gives greater distance. 
The internal flow floods with blue and recedes with red. 
Color reflects weakness. 
The Golden Isle is on the water. 
The legend of the mermaid has been handed down from past to present. 
Uhhn... Link! ...It's ended. Thank you, Link. You halted the completion of the rites that would have revived Ganon! Since they could not sacrifice me in their final rite, the powers of darkness could revive only a mindless, raging Ganon. Your power, wisdom and courage were able to prevent Twinrova's planned resurrection of Ganon. Now hope and peace can return to the hearts of the people. Thank you! You are a true hero! Let us return to the others! 
Zelda! I am glad to see you return safely... Link! You are all I expected! I always believed in you! 
I knew you would find a way, Link! Let us dance together again! 
Welcome back, Zelda, and you, too, Link. It's all over, isn't it? 
Link... The three (Triforce) on your left hand symbolize power, wisdom and courage-- these are the mark of the hero who is fated to appear when peace crumbles in Hyrule. With the Essences of Nature and Time and the courage you possess, you have fought back the powers of evil! The guidance of the Triforce has made you into this legendary hero! Thank you, Link. 
Oh, no!!! The castle is crumbling now that the powers of shadow wane! We must get out of here! 
! ! ! What do we do..? 
Let me ease your weariness. Close your eyes... 
Come see me whenever your quest has made you weary. 
Please listen, young one! You may not believe this, but I am the Queen Fairy, guardian of this sea! The curse of an evil one named Veran has made me appear so! The magic of Fairy Powder can turn me back to normal. Veran has poisoned the sea. Soon all living things in it will perish! Please go find some Fairy Powder! 
You brought me Fairy Powder! Now I can return to normal! Sprinkle the powder on me! 
Thank you, young one! Now I can cleanse the seas of evil! 
I... I am called (Bipin's Son) 
... ! ! ! ! ! ! Oops! I spoke to a stranger! 
You're Link? I'm (Bipin's Son) ! No way! 
Are you strong? -Yes -No 
I'll be strong, too, so I can protect my mom and dad! 
Huh??? And it doesn't bother you?!? 
I can't wait to be a grownup. 
I am Bipin, the expert arborist! I know plenty about trees. Now let me tell you somethin'! Blossom and I just had our first child! Yes! We did!!! Have a look! 
So, the name is decided! (Bipin's Son), huh? It's a fine name! I hope he grows to be a fine child! 
Hey, Link! My boy is ill, but still I have something to teach you. 
My boy is well, so I can rest! Today, I have more to teach! 
Hey, Link! (Bipin's Son) grows by the day, and today, I have more to teach! 
Link! It's been too long! I've moved to this city, too. It's nice to see a familiar face! 
Hey, Link! (Bipin's Son) is doing well! And I can teach you everything about trees! 
Hey, Link! (Bipin's Son) is all grown up and off on his own! I'll teach you everything about trees! 
The contents of a Gasha Nut depend on where the seed was planted. If you find a good spot, tell me! 
Inside a Gasha Nut? More than anything, you find Magic Rings, but sometimes you find Rupees or hearts. 
I've heard that a nut'scontents depend on the actions of the planter. The more he travels and the more beasts he slays, the better his nut will do! 
Finding new places to plant Gasha Seeds and finding secret stairways seems to be good for Gasha Nuts. 
And helping those in need is good for Gasha Nuts. 
Finding spots to plant Gasha Seeds is hard. Dig holes, move rocks. 
My experience holds that planting Gasha Seeds in strange spots produces more rare and unusual results! 
A traveler once told me the time it takes for a planted Gasha Seed to mature into a tree is related to how many monsters you slay. Could this be true? 
Darn Gasha Seeds! Sproutin'! Growin'! Makin' nuts! And all those new nuts got different stuff inside! Hah! Get rid of it for me! 
I know there's soil right by my house, but don't go plantin' seeds there! 
Huh? My name? It's Pippin! Don't forget it! 
I am Blossom. This is my first child--a healthy baby boy! But I am having trouble choosing a name. Can you help me think of one? What would you call him? 
You would name him (Bipin's Son) ? -Yes -No

I hope (Bipin's Son) will grow strong and healthy, like you.

Really? How much can you lend us? 150 50 10 1
Thank you, Link! You are a true samaritan! 
Thank you. This should be just enough.

I understand... 
(Bipin's Son)has gotten better! Thank you! 
My baby never sleeps. How can I get him to sleep, Link? -Sing -Play 
I like to sing! I'll try it! 
I see! If we play, he'll get all tired out. Thank you! 
Well? Isn't he a darling baby? 
See! (Bipin's Son) has grown!

You were? I never would have guessed... 
I guess it's hard to sum it up in a word.

(Bipin's Son), my son, heard of your deeds, and is now trying to become a hero himself. 
That child has high hopes and big dreams!!! 
(Bipin's Son) said he is writing a song about your deeds! 
(Bipin's Son)... He's grown up, but he idles his time away. What am I to do? 
My son is now a great hero, too. 
(Bipin's Son) has followed in Bipin's footsteps. We're so happy! 
Have you heard (Bipin's Son)'s songs? They're quite nice. 
Thank you! Now I can take him to the doctor. 
It looks like you don't have enough Rupees. 
Thank you! 
Then be gone!

Finally! My song is now finished! Will you listen? -Yes -No

With this, you can add to the greenery, too! 
Someday, I shall fill the world with my trees! 
You can ask me anything about trees. 
Most enemies stop moving when you hit them with Pegasus Seeds, but not strong ones. 
Mystery Seeds are amazing! They can take the shock out of electrical beasts. 
I must dig holes to plant trees, but sometimes, I find huge Rupees! 
Have you heard of Gale Seeds? They usually bring up a twister, but you can use them to blow enemies far away, too! 
Most monsters stop moving when you hit them with Pegasus Seeds, but not strong ones.

Your secrets have called forth new power! Come again anytime. 
One secret has already been given shape. Go get it, then come tell me another secret.

You told me this secret already.

Do you want to know the secret to going to Holodrum? -Yes -No 
Farore's Memory Read this book? -Yes -No 
I don't remember that secret, so I cannot give shape to it. 
Ah hah hah hah! 
Thank you, Link! You allowed me to pass through the sacred barrier! I've been waiting for this moment! I am Veran, Sorceress of Shadows! 
Nayru! Oracle of Ages! I shall make your body my own! Ah hah hah hah! 
Hah! Aren't you brave! Turning a sword at me! If you cut me, it's Nayru who dies! 
Nayru is no mere diva! She is the Oracle of Ages, who controls time! Now the oracle's powers are mine. I can travel through time as I choose! 
Now a new age shall begin... The age of darkness!!! Ah hah hah hah! 
You are correct! Not bad for a diva... Not bad for Nayru, Oracle of Ages! Something terrible will happen right now before your very eyes! 
I shall go to the past and do as I please! 
Link! I am amazed you have come so far... 
Wait! 
Do you mean to turn your sword on me? Hah hah hah hah! If you want to hurt Nayru, then go right ahead! 
Uhh... Not bad at all! Just wait until next time... 
Hah hah hah!!! The queen comes with impeccable timing! 
 Hahh... The body of a queen suits me just fine! Do you know what I am going to do now? Let me tell you!
Meet the petrified ones! I shall catch them all! 
Well done! I thought I might possess you this time. Perhaps you have a different flavor from that fool, Ralph. 
You've seen me like this before, but this is my true form. You'll regret making me show my true might! 
I'll give you reasons to fear Veran, Sorceress of Shadows!!! 
Ughh... I never expected to be beaten by this boy... 
This should not have happened to me... 
How cold of you to run off and leave me all alone! But, my, aren't you courageous! You've spoiled all my plans! I hoped to avoid revealing this vile shape... You'll pay for my humiliation with your life! Now, Link, it is your turn to taste despair... and the fear of death! 
My... My body withers... But you are too late! My role... was to disrupt the currents of time... To flood humanity in sorrow... The despair that fills this land has already passed through this tower and on to Twinrova! I see it... Burning blue... The Flame of Sorrow!!! Hah hah hah... 
I'll be waiting, Link... to haunt you... And the Evil King Ganon... will plunge the world... into darkness! 
This is the animal's utopia! Soon more animals come!
What a great spot! Such clean air! Now if only time could stop! 
How charming... 
Sit here and listen. How charming... 
Huh? Nayru's the best singer in Labrynna! 
La la li li la
La Li li la
Isn't it enchanting? 
I am going to be a princess! 
We're going to build paradise! 
You don't work, you don't eat! 
I'm hungry! When's dinner? 
If you believe, it will be! 
I want to be a real princess, like Princess Zelda! 
Get along with humans, too! That's my motto! 
The world is so peaceful. I'm going to build my own utopia! 
Utopian dream
La la
Utopia
The world is at peace, the air is clean! It's like a dream! 
Bwoop! Bwoop! 
Nayru is gone so there are no more songs... 
I thought we'd hear songs when Nayru returned, but I guess now isn't the time. 
Nayru's songs are so wonderfully enchanting... 
I can't stand not being able to hear Nayru sing!!! 
Listen quietly to Nayru's songs! 
Without Nayru's songs, I can't jump in rhythm. 
How long until Nayru sings again? 
Where has Nayru gone to?!? 
I can't relax without Nayru's songs! 
I haven't had any visitors in some time. I am Patch, the restoration guru. Did you need me? -Yes -No 
You must have time to kill if you came all the way here. 
You don't seem to have anything I can restore. So, what then? 
Heh, heh! I see. You want me to repair that (item). My Restoration Ceremony might fix it. ...Want to try? -Yes -No 
Then that (item) will never be restored... 
You are willing to try? Very well. Follow me. Heh, heh! 
Welcome to Patch's Crazy Cart! Will you partake in my ceremony? -Yes -No 
Very well! Do you want to hear the rules? -No -Yes 
Then let me explain! I'll place your (item) on that green tile and recite the words of my Restoration Ceremony. You must knock all the beasts that appear into a hole--any hole will do. Sounds easy, right? ...However!!! Restoration is delicate work. Your precious (item) sits on these tracks... The cart starts moving when the ceremony begins. As long as you stand on the switch, the cart won't hit your (item), but if you don't and it gets hit,
BANG!!! So? Will you take part in this fun--err, delicate ceremony? -Yes -No 
Let the ceremony begin! 
Dex ifeb!!! Dex iflla!!! 
The ceremony failed, but your (item) seems to have survived. Try again sometime. 
Hmm... Eh, heh! My ceremony succeeded! You are talented. You got through this trap--err, ceremony. Here is your (item), as good as new! As usual, I am perfect! 
Here you go. 
Bring me any- thing else that needs fixing, and I'll prepare my trap--err, ceremony! 
I haven't seen you in awhile. If you've come all the way up the wall, you must need something fixed. But my fun-- err, delicate ceremony, is more difficult now. Do you wish to try? -Yes -No 
There is nothing the restoration guru cannot repair! 
Tuni Nut 
Broken Sword 
Mermaid's Eye 
Are you also searching for that which Ambi desires? You should not go further! There are hordes of terrible beasts! 
Did you find what Ambi desires? 
Ambi's bombs have tremendous power! 
Queen Ambi is busy! She's in no mood for any who come empty- handed! Bring her a rare item in tribute if you wish to see her. 
Not bad, kid! You found them! Now come with me to meet Queen Ambi! 
Queen Ambi! He says he wishes to pay tribute! He brings the Mystery Seeds Your Majesty has been seeking! 
I shall guide you. 
Yes, Your Majesty! 
Nice work, kid! Ambi was most pleased! You may go now! 
Don't loiter around here too much, kid!!! 
You! You can't come in without permission! 
Those are the Mystery Seeds Queen Ambi has been demanding! Nice work, kid! I'll take you to the palace! 
Let's go, kid! 
We must finish the tower for Ambi as quickly as possible! 
Loafers won't get off easy! 
What, kid?!? Did you come to help us build? 
Ambi has gone alone on a soul-searching journey. I hope she returns safely... 
We must keep the palace safe while Ambi is away! 
Ambi said she was going on a soul-searching journey, but perhaps she went to search for her lover. 
You! Kids aren't allowed in... Sir Link! Excuse me! 
It is our job to guard the palace with our lives! 
You look just like the statue outside... Say! Are you Link?!? I never thought I'd actually get get to you!
