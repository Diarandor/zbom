The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past (GBA)
Complete text transcript
By EvilGiegue (evilgiegue@hotmail.com)
Version 1.0 - March 2004
------------------------------------------------------

This is a reproduction of the text in the Gameboy Advance version of
The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. ALL the text from the regular game
can be found here, from the most crucial plot dialogue down to the most
insignificant messages, and possibly even some leftover lines not used in the
final version of the game!

Normally I'd accomplish this by ripping the text data straight from the game.
However, since I couldn't find where that data was in this game's code or how
it was compressed, I did the next best thing: I found how to change the
message displayed at one point in the game, and went through all possible
values for it (456 in total if you're curious) and wrote down the resulting
messages in this file. The result is essentially the same thing as a text dump.

This is mostly useful for people who are looking for a particular passage from
the game but don't want to play through all of it just to get one line, people
who are curious about the storyline and want to be sure they haven't missed
anything, or people who want to compare differences between the GBA port and
the original Snes version. Messages are presented in the same order as they
appear in in the game's data. Interestingly, this order is the exact same as
can be found in the Snes game, with new messages specific to this version added
at the end.

Since this is actually a transcription of the game's text and not a direct rip,
it is possible that I have made some mistakes or typos. In some cases though,
the errors were in the game in the first place. There are three such occurances
that I noticed, which I have marked with the mention "[Sic]".

You can't enter with me.

Link, I'm going out for a
bit, but there's no need for
you to worry.
I'll be back by morning, but
I don't want you leaving the
house until then...
Go back to bed...
and wait for me to return.

Unnh... That voice... Link?
Is it you? I thought I told you
to wait at home...
I suppose there's no escaping
destiny... Here, take this
sword and shield from me.
I shall teach you one of the
secret sword techniques used
by the Knights of Hyrule...
Hold the B Button to focus
power in your blade. Release it
to unleash the power.
Link...you must rescue
Princess Zelda. Our people are
fated to do so.
But do not fall victim...
to fate... Link...
I shall always remember...
our time... together...

Hey! What are you doing out on
a stormy night like this?
A kid like you should be
heading home and going to bed!
But if you plan on staying out,
then keep talking to us
soldiers.
We'll teach you a thing or two!

If you get lost wandering the
streets, press the L Button
to check your map.
But maybe you already knew
that...

You look strong for a kid. How
much can you lift?
-
You know you can press the R
Button when you're touching
something to lift it, right?
I'll bet you didn't know that!
...Or did you?

I'll bet you can't wait to get
a sword like mine! You just
press the B Button to use it.
But maybe you knew that...

You found the Bow!
Now you can shoot arrows!
(At least until you run out...)

Wow! Your map has a blinking
mark on it! I bet that's where
you're supposed to go!
Oh... I guess that was
completely obvious.

You know what's really cool?
If you stand in front of a
chest and press the R button.
Pa-ching! The chest opens!
But I guess that's to be
expected, huh?

I don't mean to brag, but
aren't we soliders a
smart bunch?
Not that you should be out on
a stormy night like that just
to hear what we have to say...

First, you should go meet the
the village elder and get the     [Sic]
Master Sword.

Princess Zelda? You are safe!
And you are the one who
rescued her, Link?

I sense that a mighty evil
force guides the wizard's
actions and augments his
magical power. The only weapon
potent enough to defeat the
wizard is the legendary
Master Sword...but the only
person remaining who has any
idea of where this blade may be
is the village elder. He is said
to be a descendant of one of
the seven sages.
Perhaps he can tell you more.
I will mark his house on your
map. But we must take care!
I am certain the castle soldiers
are looking for you and the
princess now! ... ... ...
The two of you cannot stay
together, so I shall hide
Princess Zelda here.
Do not worry! Seek the elder!
... ... ...
Do you understand?
     Yes
     Not at all

If you defeat the wizard, the
castle soldiers may regain
their senses.
Go, seek the Pendants!

Take the three Pendants into
the Lost Woods. The Master
Sword awaits you there!

Link! If only you had come
sooner... A group of soldiers
was here...
They took Princess Zelda. I
fear they have taken her to
the highest room in the tower.
They mean to sacrifice her!
You must find her before the
wizard works his magic.
Please, Link...
You are our only hope...

Thank you, Link. I had a
feeling you were getting close.

It's thanks to Link that I
escaped from the dungeon!
When I was captive the wizard
said, "Once I have finished
with you, the final one, the
sages' seal will open."
... ... ...
Link, you must not let the
land of Hyrule fall into the
wizard's clutches.
If he breaks the seal of the
seven sages, a wave of evil
power will be unleashed.
If that happens, the people of
Hyrule shall never again
know peace...
Before that happens...
Before it's too late... Please!
You must defeat the wizard
before he destroys all of
Hyrule! You can... You must!

Be careful, Link!
May you see this task safely
through to its end!

Help me...
-
Please help me...
I am a prisoner in the castle
dungeon.
My name is Zelda...
The wizard, Agahnim, has done
something terrible to the other
girls...
Now only I remain...
Agahnim has seized control of
the castle and even now is
trying to open the sages' seal.
I am in the dungeon of the
castle.
Please help me...

Help me...
I am in the dungeon of the
castle.
Somewhere outside the castle
you should find a hidden
entrance to the palace garden.

There is a secret passage in
the throne room that leads to
the Sanctuary. I'm sure the old
man there will help us.
We must hurry.

That ornamental shelf should
open. Do you have a light?
It's pitch-dark inside, and you
can't see without one.
If you're ready, let's go!
We have to push it from the
left. Come on! Help me!

You have to pull the lever to
open the door. Hold the R
Button and press [down] on the
[cross] Control Pad.

Good! We should go quickly
before the wizard notices us. I
know a secret path, but we
must go to the first floor
to reach it. Let's go!

Link, listen carefully. All
the soldiers in the castle have
fallen under the wizard's spell.
And I fear even worse has
befallen my father... That
wizard is an inhuman fiend!
His powers are strong...
... ... ...
Do you understand?
   Yes
   Not at all

You should follow the marks
the elder made on your map
when you explore.
If you don't know what to do
next, you can also visit a
fortune-teller.

Link, you are wonderful!
As I thought, you have the
power of the Hero inside you!
Now, you should get the Master
Sword. I feel sure that you
can defeat the evil wizard!

Link! Help! The soldiers
are coming to the Sanctuary!
AIEEEEEEE!
... ... ...

After passing through these
sewers, we will be very close
to the Sanctuary!
Let's be careful!

The Sanctuary is just beyond
that door. Pull the switch
over there.

Who? Oh, it's you, Evil!
What can an old woman like me
do for a youngster like you?
Who? The elder? Oh... No one
has seen him since the wizard
began abducting his victims...
... ... ...
What? Master Sword? Well, I
don't remember the details
exactly, but...

Long ago a prosperous people,
known as the Hylians, inhabited
this land...
Legends tell of treasures with
mystical powers that remain
from the Hylian age...
The Master Sword, a mighty
blade forged to thwart those
with evil hearts, is one...
It is said that even now
it rests deep in the forest.
... ... ...
Do you understand the legend?
     Yes
     Not at all

At any rate, seek the elder.
There must be someone in the
village who knows where he is.
Link...
Take care...

Ohhh, Link. You've changed!
You look marvelous... Please
save the village from Agahnim!

Hey! It's Link, the wanted
man! He's over here! Soldiers!
Anyone! Come quickly!

Hmmm... So at last you have
the three Pendants... Good!
Now head for the Lost Woods.
If you are the true Hero,
the sword will choose you to
wield it...

I am but an old man.
I can't even grip the hilt
of my sword...
You are all I have to rely on.

I am, indeed, Sahasrahla, the
village elder and a descendant
of the seven sages.
... ... Oh really?
I am surprised that one so
young is searching for the
sword of evil's bane, Link.
Not just anyone can use that
blade. Legends say only the
Hero who has won the three
Pendants can wield the sword.
... ... ...
Do you truly wish to find it?
     Uh, yeah...
     Of course!

Good! For your first test, can
you retrieve the Pendant of
Courage from the East Palace?
If you bring it here, I shall
share more of my knowledge
with you.
Now, onward to the palace!

Other relatives of the seven
sages are also hiding
from the wizard's followers.
You should seek them, as well.

Link, it is I, Sahasrahla.
I am communicating with you
across the void through
telepathy... The place where
you now stand was the Golden
Land, but evil power turned it
into the Dark World. The
wizard has broken the sages'
seal and turned the gate to
Hyrule Castle into a portal
linking that world to this. In
order to save this half of the
world, the Light World, you
must win back the Golden
Power. You must also rescue
the seven maidens who Agahnim
sent to the Dark World. As
descendants of the seven
sages, they have power that
will surely aid you.
The maidens are locked in
hidden dungeons full of evil
creatures and dangerous traps.
The Palace of Darkness should
be your first goal in this world!
Link, you are our last
hope. Please make this old
man's wishes come true.
I beg you!

But I sense your helplessness.
Before you go any further,
find the Moon Pearl on
Death Mountain. It will protect
you from the Dark World's
magic so you can retain your
heroic figure.

An item that shall aid you is
hidden in the cave on the east
side of Lake Hylia. Go find it!

So, you got the Pendant of
Courage! Then I shall tell you
more of the legend...
Generations ago, an order of
knights protected the Hylian
royalty. These Knights of
Hyrule were also guardians
of the Pendant of Courage.
It has been said that whenever
disaster waylays the royal
family, a Hero shall emerge
from the bloodline of the
Knights of Hyrule...
Unfortunately, most of them
were destroyed in the great
war against evil that took
place when the seven sages
created their seal, so it was
thought that a hero would
never again emerge...
But lo! I believe you are our
hero, Link! Find the
remaining Pendants.
And carry this with you.
It is a treasure passed down
by the families of the sages.
I want you to have it.

You are correct, young man!
I am Sahasrahla, the village
elder and a descendant of the
seven sages.
... ... ... What?
Link, I'm surprised that one
as young as you is seeking the
sword of evil's bane. Not just
anyone can use that sword.
According to the tales handed
down by the Hylians, only the
Hero of has destroyed three
great evils and won the three
Pendants can wield the sword...
I see you have acquired the
Pendant of Courage. I will tell
you about the legend behind it.
Generations ago, an order of
knights protected the Hylian
royalty.
These Knights of Hyrule were
also guardians of the Pendant
of Courage.
It has been said that whenever
disaster waylays the royal
family, a Hero shall emerge
from the bloodline of the
Knights of Hyrule...
Unfortunately, most of them
were destroyed in the great
war against evil that took
place when the seven sages
created their seal, so it
was thought a hero would
never again emerge...
But lo! I believe you are our
hero, Link! Find the
remaining Pendants.
And carry this with you.
It is a treasure passed down
by the families of the sages.
I want you to have it.

I will give 100 Rupees to the
man who finds me the descendants
of the seven sages.  THE KING

Mmmmm... The smell of rotten
fruit... If you give me that
Mushroom, I can finish my brew.
Heh heh...

If you want to buy the potion,
you should bring a bottle to

Blue renews both life and
magic.

You bought Zora's Flippers!
With these you should be able
to swim even in deep water!

hands! You can pick up and
carry stones now!

You won the Pendant of
Courage! Take it to
Sahasrahla!
Two Pendants remain!

You won the Pendant of Power!
Your goal of finding all three
Pendants is in sight!
Go for the last one!

You won the Pendant of Wisdom!
With this, you've collected
all three Pendants! Go now to
the Lost Woods to get
the Master Sword!

This Mushroom smells like sweet
rotten fruit...
You can give this to anyone
who wants it. (Select it and
press the A Button.)

You found the Book of Mudora!
You can use it to read the
ancient language of the Hylia!

You found the Moon Pearl!
This protects The Hero from
the transforming effects of
the Golden Power.

Now you can pinpoint the
lair of the dungeon's evil
master!

Use it to see your current
position and the rest of the

You found the Ice Rod!
Its chill magic blasts the air!
But watch your Magic Meter!

You found the Fire Rod!
This rod commands red fire,
but watch your Magic Meter!

Watch your Magic Meter!

to shake and defeats
nearby enemies!
Watch your Magic Meter!

You got the Magic Hammer!
You can now drive wooden
stakes down into the ground!
You can use it to pound on
other things too!

Oh! Here's the Flute!
Its music surely has some
mysterious power!

You got the Cane of Somaria!
If you use it strategically,
this mysterious cane will
be of tremendous help!

BOING! It's the Hookshot!
It extends! And contracts!
And... BOING! It can grapple
many things!

You got some bombs!
You can pick up and throw
a bomb you've placed!
(Press the R Button!)

This is a Magic Bottle!
You can store an item
inside and then use it later!

You got the Big Key!
This is the master key of the
dungeon. It can open many
locks that small keys cannot.

You got the Titan's Mitt!
Now you can lift the heaviest
stones that were once
impossible to budge.

He gave you the Magic Mirror!
This mirror is blue, clear, and
beautiful...
You feel like it's going to
pull you into another world...

This is it! The Master Sword!
... ... ...
No, this can't be it... Too bad.

Sahasrahla's voice echoes
from the void...
... ... ...
Link, you have done well
to obtain the evil-banishing
blade, the Master Sword...
The power that shines in it
is now yours to wield!
With it, you should be able to
thwart the magic of the evil
wizard Agahnim.
The destiny of this land
is in your hands.
Please, Link...

Heh heh heh... Thank you!
This is the Medicine of Life.
Use it to regain your life
power.

Heh heh heh... Thank you!
This is the Medicine of Magic.
You can recharge your mystic
energy with it.

Heh heh heh... Thank you!
This is the Medicine of Life and
Magic! You can recover both!

You borrowed the Bug-Catching
Net! There may be some other
things you can catch with it,
too.

You found the Blue Mail!
This armor reduces the damage
that you take from enemies!

You found the Red Mail!
This provides even better
protection than the Blue Mail!

Great! Your sword is stronger!
You can feel the sheer power
flowing through your body!

You found the Mirror Shield!
You can now reflect beams
that you old shield
couldn't block!

You got the Cane of Byrna!
If you swing it once, a ring of
light will protect you!

Eh? It's locked!
If you had the Big Key, you
might be able to open it!

You're short on magic power!
You can't use this item now.
Watch you Magic Meter!

He gave you the Pegasus
Shoes! Now you can execute a
devastating dash attack!
(Hold the R Button
for a short time.)

Wow! I haven't seen a normal
person in a few hundred years!
Let me talk to you for a while.

Do you know about the
Gargoyle statue in the village?
People say they can hear a girl
calling for help from under the
statue. Isn't that a strange
story...?

Surprisingly, the Triforce
created this world to fulfill
Ganon's wish.
What is Ganon's wish,
you ask? It's to rule the
entire cosmos! Don't you think
it might be possible with the
power of the Trifore
behind you?

I once lived in the Lost Woods,
until the day I wandered into a
magical transporter...
The power of the Dark World
quickly turned me into this
tree shape...
I guess the two forests are
connected with each other...

I heard that using bombs is the
best way to defeat the
one-eyed giants.
That's all I know!

Quit bothering me! And watch
where you're going when you
dash around!

You got the Pendant of Power!
You have now collected all
three Pendants! Go forth now
to the Lost Woods for the
Master Sword!

You got the Pendant of Wisdom!
Your power's increased again!
Now, go for the last one!

Well howdy, Light Worlder!
You look like a straight
shooter... Want to try your
skills in my shooting gallery?
I'll give you five shots for 20
Rupees. If you're as sharp
as I think you are, you stand
to rake in the Rupees.
How about it, stranger?
     Play
     No way

All right! Aim carefully!
Ready! GO!

Well, little partner, you can
turn yourself right around and
leave the same way you
came in.
See you later! Have a nice day!

Want to shoot again?
     Continue
     Quit

--POND OF HAPPINESS--
Throw some Rupees in and your
wishes will surely come true.
Do you want to throw Rupees?
     Throw a few
     Don't feel like it

Select an item using the
[Cross] Control Pad and throw it
using the A Button. [Picture of selected item]

Hello there. Did you drop this?
     Yes
     No, I didn't

I like an honest person.
I will give you something better
in return.

Are you sure this is not yours?
     Really, it isn't
     To tell the truth, it is

Now, now, don't tell lies.
Please take it back.

You got the Magical Boomerang!
You can throw this faster and
farther than your old one!

Your shield is improved!
Now you can defend yourself
against fireballs!

These are the Silver Arrows
you need to defeat Ganon!

She filled your bottle with the
Medicine of Magic. That worked
out well for you!

Your sword is stronger!
You can feel its power
throbbing in your hand!

Happiness increased 00 Rupees.
In total, your Happiness is 00.
You became happier by one
step.

I will make your wish come true.
     I want to carry more bombs
     I want to carry more arrows

Then I will increase your
carrying ability so you can
carry a maximum of 00 bombs.
This is just a small happiness
I can give to you.

Then I will increase your
carrying ability so you can
carry a maximum of 00 arrows.
This is just a small happiness
I can give to you.

I cannot grant any more wishes
for you, but a friend of mine
might be able to...
She lives in the Waterfall Of
Wishing near Zora's lake.
I will return your Rupees to
you. May you be happy...

Uhhh... Watch your step.
There are holes in the ground.
Could you turn right here?
Young man, are you also going
to the mountain to look for the
Golden Power?
Just ahead is a mountain full
of monsters. Many people have
vanished in this mountain while
looking for the Golden Power.
-
-
I don't want to steer you
wrong, so please don't get too
involved in such a mad quest.

Uhh... There must be a heart in
the bottle.

Uhh... Turn right here... ...
You know, I have a
granddaughter who is your
age... The king took her to the
castle and she never returned.
Kidnapping those maidens must
be part of the wizard's plot!
I'm sure he is trying somehow
to use the power of the
descendants of the seven
sages...

I don't know who you are, but
if you are going to go up
the mountain, will you take me
with you? I lost my lamp,
so...

The missing maidens are still
alive somewhere. I believe that
a Hero will rescue them...
I wait for that day...
Uhh... These are dangerous
times... I've talked too much.
Anyway... Thank you for being
kind to an old man like me.
Uh... I wanted to give you
this. If you wander into
a magical transporter, gaze
into this mirror.

The wizard has deceived the
king, and now he is trying to
open the way to the
Dark World. To complete
your quest, you will need
the Moon Pearl, which is in the
tower on top of the mountain.
All I can do for you now is
comfort your weariness...
Come back here any time.

The Moon Pearl will protect its
bearer from the magical air of
the Golden Land, so you can
keep your human shape there.
All I can do for you now is
comfort your weariness...
Come back here any time.

Link, I think the wizard has
created a portal between the
two worlds somewhere near the
castle. All I can do for you now
is to comfort your weariness...
Visit me any time.

Ohhh... My poor flute-playing
son... How I miss the sound of
his flute. He went to look for
the Golden Power but he has
not returned...
I wonder where he is and what
he's doing now?
...Zzzzzz Zzzzzz...

Mumble mumble... Oh? This
flute! This is my son's flute!
Have you seen my son?
Where is he? Is he all right?
... ... ...
-
Oh... You don't need to say.
I understand just from the look
in your eyes...
Could you keep that flute?
Then you can play it
for the birds in town in my
son's stead.
Please do this for me.
It would make my son so happy.
...I just wish I could have
seen him one more time...

Snore... ...Zzzzzz Zzzzzz...

Oh, Link. Someone's been
spreading rumors, saying you
kidnapped the princess...
but I still trust you.

I can't believe you caught me!
With your speed it must have
been easy to kidnap Zelda...
You don't look like such a bad
guy, though...
Anyway, because you have
such quick feet, it might be a
good idea to run and bash into
many things...
For example, the trees in this
village have many useful things
hanging in their branches...
Well, just try it, OK?!

If you have enough time to
read this sign, you should go
to the goal immediately!

I'll give a Piece of Heart to
the person who wears the Cape.

Curses to anyone who throws
something into my circle of
stones.

After Agahnim took over,
everyone began to act
strangely.
I suppose it's only
a matter of time before
I'm affected, too.

Hey hey! You're not allowed in
the castle, son!
Go home and get some sleep!

Link, it is I, Sahasrahla. I
can talk to you telepathically
when you touch these tiles.
I have advice for you...
The treasure hidden in this
palace will help you defeat
armored foes.

Link, it is I, Sahasrahla the
elder. An orb known as the
Moon Pearl rests in this tower.
He who holds the Moon Pearl
is protected, and his form will
not change in the Dark World.
You must find it and escape
from the tower!
Do not forget the Moon Pearl...

way to the top of Spectacle
Rock. From there you can
reach the Tower of Hera on
Top of Death Mountain.

Link, it is I, Sahasrahla.
Objects in the Light and Dark
Worlds mimic one another.
If the form of a thing changes
in one world, it will change the
shape of its twin in the other.

Link... It's me, Zelda...
Don't be deceived by the magic
of Blind the Thief! Be careful!

Link, it is I, Sahasrahla
the elder! Set the four
torches alight and the way
ahead shall surely open.

[Hylian text]

To open the way forward...
Make your wish here...
And it will be granted.

When Ganon is stunned, seal
his fate with a Silver Arrow!
-
Do you understand, Link?

Link, can you hear me?
It's me, Zelda. I'm locked in
Turtle Rock on top of Death
Mountain. I know you're doing
your best, but please hurry...

Link, it is I, Sahasrahla.
Be sure to find the treasures
hidden in each dungeon.

Listen well, Link.
Even with the Master Sword,
you cannot inflict physical
harm on the wizard.
You must find a way to return
his own evil magic power to him.

Link, you must not exhaust
your magic power. You will
have need of it ahead.
If you do not have possess the     [Sic]
Medicine of Magic, then proceed
with caution.
Do not overexert yourself...

Link, do you possess the
Medicine of Magic? If not, I
recommend against going any
further.

Listen to my words, Link...
The magic flames wil protect
you inside this icy dungeon.

You cannot destroy the
Skeleton Knight with the sword
alone. When he collapses, he is
vulnerable to another weapon.

Link, it is I, Sahasrahla the
elder. I have some advice...
In the dungeons, you can gaze
into the Magic Mirror to return
to the entrace at any time.
Do not forget this!

This is my top-secret room.
Keep it between us, OK?

You caught a bee!
What will you do?
     Keep it in a bottle
     Set it free

You caught a fairy!
What will you do?
     Keep it in a bottle
     Set it free

You don't have any empty
bottles. You have no choice...
Just set it free.

This try your time was
00 minutes 00 seconds.

If you can reach the goal
within 15 seconds, we will give
you something good.
Ready, set... ... ...GO!

You qualified!
Congratulations!
I present you with a Piece of
Heart!

You didn't qualify.
Too bad!
Why don't you try again?

I don't have anything more to
give you.
I'm sorry!

You have to enter the maze
from the proper entrace or I
can't clock your time...

You, sir! Have you been going
through life without one of my
hold-anything bottles?
Well, step right up and make
your life complete! I've got
one on sale now for the low,
low price of 100 Rupees!
What do you say? Interested?
     I'll take one
     Don't need it

Good buy! Thanks a lot!
Now, hold it above your head
for the whole world to see, OK?
It's good for business!

So you're broke, eh? Too bad...
Come back after you earn more
Rupees. It might still be here.

I'm all sold out of bottles.
Come back later, OK?
... ... ...

Wow! I've never seen such a
rare bug! I'll buy it for
100 Rupees, OK? Done!

Hey! They say eating fish
makes you smart. You have to
give me your fish for this
stuff, OK? Of course!

Yo! Link! You seem to be in
a heap of trouble, but this is
all I can give you.

Hey, you!
Welcome!
-
Ask us for whatever you need!
     Temper my sword
     I just dropped by

I'll give you a big discount!
     Sword Tempering: 10 Rupees
     Wait a minute

Tempering, eh? Are you sure?
     Yes
     I changed my mind

Well, we can't make it any
stronger than that... Sorry!

Drop by again anytime you
want to. Yo ho! Yo ho!
Let's get to work!

All right, no problem.
We'll have to keep your sword
for a while.

Your sword is tempered!
Now hold it!

If my lost partner returns
we can temper your sword,
but right now I can't do
anything for you.

Oh! What is this?!?
You found my partner!
...Happy days are here again!
Drop by here again sometime!
Then we will temper your
sword perfectly!

Ribbit ribbit... Your body did
not change! You are not just
an ordinary guy, are you?
I used to live in Kakariko Town.
I wonder what my buddy is
doing there without me...
Ribbit! I have a request of
you. I beg you...
Please take me to my partner!
Please! Ribbit! Please!

I'm sorry, we're not done yet.
Come back after a while.

Thank you!
-
Thank you!

Hey hey, amateurs shouldn't
try to do this. You're just
getting in the way!

After wandering into this world
I was changed into this shape.
... ... ...
Back in my world, I played my
beloved flute day and night...
There was a small grove there
where the animals would gather
when I played. I would love to
see that place again...
Before I came here I
buried my flute there, along
with some flower seeds.
Will you try to find it for me?
     Yes
     No way

Then I will lend you my shovel.
Good luck!

... ... ...
I see. I won't ask you again...
Good-bye.

Did you find my flute?
... ... ...
Please keep looking for it...

Thank you, Link. But it
looks like I can't play my flute
any more. Please take it.
If by chance you go to the
village I lived in, please give
it to a tired old man you will
find there.
... ... ...
Well, my mind is getting
hazy...
Please let me hear the sound of
the flute one last time...

Hocus pocus!
You will find the elder
Sahasrahla...

Abracadabra alakazam!
You will open a desert lock with
the Book of Mudora.

Hocus pocus!
You will find a descendant of
a sage's line in the desert.

Abracadabra alakazam!
You will find a mushroom lover
at the Magic Shop...

Hocus pocus!
You will find a lake where Zoras
live far up the river...

Abracadabra alakazam!
A chest in the mountain tower
holds the Moon Pearl...
And you will find it!

Hocus Pocus!
Even the mighty Master Sword
cannot harm the wizard's body.

Abracadabra alakazam!
The true Hero will jump into the
well near the smithy's shop.

Well, I have to say my condition
isn't very good today. But I
want you to come back again...

Hmmm... You look like you might
have an interesting destiny...
May I tell your fortune?
I'll make it cheap...
     Ask him to tell it
     Not interested

Now I will take 00 Rupees.
I hope you will be healhy.
Yee hah ha hah!

It is indeed a poor man who is
not interested in his future...
I'll be waiting for your return.

Hocus pocus!
You will meet a strange man
standing in the desert...

Abracadabra alakazam!
Inquire about chests at the
gossip shop in the Dark World...

Hocus pocus!
You will find the smith's
partner in the
Village of Outcasts.

Abracadabra alakazam!
You will find a treasure resting
in peace in the graveyard.

Hocus pocus!
You will buy a new kind of bomb
in the Bomb Shop.

Abracadabra alakazam!
I see something hidden inside
the pyramid of the Dark World.

Hocus pocus!
You will run into a barrier if
you try to enter
Ganon's tower.

Abracadabra alakazam!
You will need Silver Arrows to
seal Ganon's fate.

Hey! I'll tell you a profitable
story if you pay me 20 Rupees.
How about it?
     Pay Rupees
     Don't want to hear it

Hah! Thank you. They say
there is a tiny circle of rocks
in the lake at the source of
the river. I don't know what
will happen, but it might be fun
to throw something into it...
Heh heh. See you...

Heh heh. I see. I'm not
interested in talking to people
who don't have Rupees...

Heh heh. Thank you. To tell
you the truth, I used to be a
thief in the Light World...
Some of my fellow thieves went
into hiding because they were
afraid of being caught.
One of them was a master
lockpicker, but now he is hiding
the fact that he was a thief...
...by pretending to be a
completely average guy!
Ha ha ha...
Hey! It almost sounds like
like I'm giving you a hint!     [Sic]

Hah! Thank you. To tell you
the truth, I saw incredible
beauty inside the pyramid,
but someone went and sealed
the door. The nerve! Not even
a bomb will blow it open now...
At least not a standard one...

Heh heh. Thank you. As a
matter of fact, monster magic
is making it rain in the swamp.
If you can move the air with
more force than the monsters,
the rain may stop.

Sniffle... Hey brother Link!
Do you have a bottle to keep
a bug in?
...
Oh, maybe not...
Cough cough...

I can't go out 'cause I'm sick...
Cough cough...
People say I caught this cold
from the evil air that's coming
down off the mountain...
Sniff sniff...
This is my bug-catching net.
I'll use it when I'm better, but
for now, I'll lend it to you.

Sniffle... I hope I get well
soon...
Cough cough...

... ... ... ... ... ...
... ... ...

Why did you take my sign? It
says plain as day to just leave
me alone! Sheeesh!

I heard that you know I used to
be a thief, right?
-
Well, I'll open a chest for you.
Will you keep it secret from
everyone else?
Would you please promise?
     Promise not to tell
     Tell it to everyone

OK, if that's the way you want
it, I hope you drag that chest
around forever!

Remember, you promised...
Don't tell anyone.

All right, bring that chest over
here... Seriously, keep this a
secret from everyone.

[Hylian text]

Hold up the Master Sword and
you will get the magic of
Ether.

Hold up the Master Sword and
you will get the magic of
Bombos.

Hey! Blast you for waking me
from my deep, dark sleep!
...I mean, thanks a lot, sir!
But now I will get my revenge
on you. Get ready for it!
...Err, is that OK with you,
sir?

Heh heh heh! I laugh at your
misfortune! Now your magic
power will drop by one-half!
Congratulations!
Now, do you best, even though
I'm sure it won't be enough!
Have a nice day! See you!

Long ago, in Hyrule, a beautiful
kingdom surrounded by forests
and mountains...
legends told of an omnipotent
and omniscient Golden Power
that lay hidden.
It was hidden in a sacred
realm beyond the reach of men,
but one day...
...a doorway to that realm
was suddenly opened...
Hoping to claim the Golden
Power as their own, the people
began to quarrel and fight...
Many sought to enter the
hidden Golden Land...
But none returned, and instead
evil power began to issue
forth from the dark portal...
So the king commanded seven
sages to seal the gate to
the land of the Golden Power.
Many brave knights were lost
in the battle to protect the
sages from the tides of evil,
but the seal was cast! Evil
flowed no more! And the seal
would remain for all time...
Or so the people hoped...
But when these events were
obscured by the mists of
time, and became legend...

A mysterious wizard known as
Agahnim appeared as from
nowhere...
and with strange magic powers
he eliminated the good king of
Hyrule...

He cast spells on the soldiers
and kidnapped young maidens
descended from the sages
in order to break the seal...

This destiny fast approaches
for the final maiden...
the princess, Zelda...

Because the key is locked
inside this chest, you can
never open it.
Just take it with you.

100 Rupees for 30 bombs! 30
Bombs for just 100 Rupees!
Please buy 'em, mister!

100 Rupees for 30 bombs! I also
have a new Super Bomb in stock
for only 100 Rupees! Please
buy it too, mister!

Thank you very much.
So very much.

Thank you very much. You can
drop this bomb off anywhere.
(Press the R Button.)
Please don't forget it.

Ki ki ki! If you give me 100
Rupees, I will open the
entrance for you. Kik ki ki!
 What will you do?
     Ask him to open it
     Try to open it yourself

Ki ki ki! Hmph!
Do it yourself, then!
Ki ki ki!

Ki ki! Good choice! Then I get
100 of your Rupees. Kik ki ki!

I'm Kiki the monkey, ki ki!
I love Rupees more than
anything. Can you spare me
10 Rupees?
 What will you do?
     Give him 10 Rupees
     Never give him anything

Ki ki ki ki! Good choice! I
will accompany you for a while.
Kik ki ki!

Ki ki! Harumph! I have no
reason to talk to you, then.
Bye-bye! Kik ki ki!

Ki ki? What are you doing?
I don't want to go there!

Ohh, thank you so much!
You saved my life. Please take
me outside.

Gyaaah!
Too bright!

Err... Wait a minute...
Please don't go this way.

I am Aginah. I sense something
is happening in the Golden Land
the seven sages sealed...
This must be an omen of the
Great Cataclysm foretold by
the people of Hylian blood...
... ... ...
The prophecy says, "The Hero
will stand in the desert holding
the Book of Mudora."
If you have the Book of Mudora
you can read the language of
the Hylian people.
It should be in the house of
books in the village...
You must get it!
If you are indeed the Hero...

You have collected the three
Pendants. If you are
indeed the Hero who has
Wisdom, Courage, and Power,
the Master Sword sleeping in
the forest will be yours.

Aha! It is the Book of Mudora.
With it, you can read the
language of the Hylian people.

You are the true Hero...
I believe that you will return
peace to this land.

Your trial in the desert has
made you stronger. The blood
of the Hero must be in your
veins...

Was it you who disturbed my
peaceful nap? I will give this
to you if you go away!

I don't have any more good
presents for you. Take this
instead, pest!

Yo Link! A mysterious fog
has recently fallen over the
forest. We have to be careful!

Maybe it's nothing, but this
tree feels kind of strange as
we cut it...

Yo! The fog in the forest is
clearing. Thank you! We can
go there again! Hey brother!

Hey, Link. I've been
quarreling with my younger
brother. It's something really
stupid, too. But sometimes you
just can't give in, you know?
So I sealed the door to his
room. That'll learn him.

So the doorway is open again...
OK, OK, maybe I should make up
with my brother...

Hey Link, did you come from
my older brother's room? Is he
still angry?

Link, because of you, I've
escaped from the clutches of
the evil monsters. Thank you!
...This world was once the
Golden Land where the Triforce
was hidden.
But because Ganon, the leader
of the thieves, wished it, this
world was transformed...
I'm sure he's intending to
conquer even our Light World
after building his power here.
His hope is to use us maidens
and the power of the sages
that has been passed on to us
as the key to open a larger
gate between the worlds near
Hyrule Castle.
But the gate is not
completely open yet...
There is still time.
Together, we seven maidens
can break the barrier that
protects Ganon's hiding place.
I can tell you where the other
girls are held. I believe you
will destroy Ganon.
I will return to my original
form at that time.
... ... ... ... ...


Link, thanks to you, I was
able to escape from the
clutches of evil. Thank you!
...The Triforce will grant the
wishes of whoever touches it,
as long as that person lives...
That is why it was hidden in
the Golden Land. Only a select
few were told of its location,
but at some point that
knowledge was lost...
The one who rediscovered
the Golden Land was
an evil thief named Ganondorf.
Luckily, he couldn't figure out
how to return to the Light
World...
...Well, remember that you
have magical powers, which only
the Hero can make use of!
There are some other magical
warping points like the one you
saw on Death Mountain.
By using them you can go
between the two worlds and
find the evils hidden in the
Dark World. You are the only
one who can destroy
Ganondorf, the thief... No!
Ganon, the evil King of
Darkness!

Link, thanks to you, I was
able to escape the clutches of
the evil monsters. Thank you!
...Do you know the prophecy of
the Great Cataclysm?
This is the way I heard it...
If a person with an evil
heart gets the Triforce, a Hero
is destined to appear...
...and he alone must face the
person who unleashed the
Great Cataclysm.
If the evil one destroys the
Hero, nothing can save the
world from his wicked reign.
Only a member of the Knights
of Hyrule, who protected the
Hylian royalty, can become
the Hero... You are of their
bloodline, aren't you? Then
you must rescue
Zelda without fail!

Link, thanks to you, I was
able to escape the clutches of
the evil monsters. Thank you!
As the sages sealed the way
to the Dark World, the Knights
of Hyrule defended them from
the attacks of evil monsters.
I heard that the Knights of
Hyrule were nearly wiped out in
that battle...
You are perhaps the last one
to carry on the bloodline of
those knights...
It's ironic that the last one in
the line has the potential to
become the Hero of legend.
Surely you can destroy Ganon!

Link, thanks to you, I was
able to escape the clutches of
the evil monsters. Thank you!
They say the Hylian people
mastered mysterious powers,
as did the seven sages.
But the blood of the Hylia has
grown thin over time. And we
who carry the blood of the
sages do not possess our
ancestors' powers, either.
But our power will increase if
we mix the courage of the
knights with the wisdom of the
sages! Perhaps there is
still a way in which we can
help you.
But there is little time before
the gate at the castle linking
the worlds opens completely.
If you defeat Ganon, this
world will vanish, and the
Triforce will wait
for a new master.
I belive in you...
Good luck!

Link, because of you, I've
escaped from the clutches of
the evil monsters. Thank you!
Ganon captured us because he
couldn't break the seal of the
sages with his power alone.
And then, using the wizard
Agahnim as his pawn, he drew us
to the Dark World.
After cracking the seal with
our powers, he sealed us inside
of these crystals.
He then gave us to his loyal
monsters. But Ganon didn't
plan on you getting this far.
Now, Princess Zelda is waiting
for you inside of Turtle Rock.
Please hurry!

I appreciate your coming so far
to rescue me. As I thought,
you are the legendary Hero.
I have felt this from the first
time we met.
... ... ...
Ganon is inside of his tower,
waiting to pass through the
gate linking the two worlds.
Once Ganon enters the Light
World, it is unlikely that
anyone can stop him.
But if he is kept in the closed
off space of this world, you
can find him wherever he runs.
Now, take the seven crystals
to Ganon's Tower! Our
combined powers will break his
barrier! Let us return peace to
the country and smiles to the
faces of the people!

May the way of the Hero lead
to the Triforce.

Do you understand?
     Yes
     Not at all

Link, we are going to break
the barrier of Ganon's Tower
with our power.

I appreciate your coming so far
to rescue me. As I thought,
you are the legendary Hero.
I have felt this from the first
time we met.
... ... ...
Ganon is inside of his tower,
waiting to pass through the
gate linking the two worlds.
Once Ganon enters the Light
World, it is unlikely that
anyone can stop him.
But if he is kept in the closed
space of this world, you can
find him wherever he runs.
Some maidens still need your
help, though. Once you rescue
them all, go to Ganon's Tower.
We who carry the bloodline of
the sages in us will then use
our power to break
Ganon's barrier!
Link... You must return
peace to the world...

Aha... Link!
I have been waiting for you!
Heh heh heh...
I thought I would make Zelda
vanish before you.
Behold! Princess Zelda's
final breath!

Ho ho ho... With this, the
seal of the seven sages is
at last broken.
It is now only a matter of time
before evil power covers this
land completely...
After all, the legendary Hero
cannot defeat us, the tribe of
evil, when we are armed with
the Power of Gold.
Ho ho ho... Now, I must go!

Ho ho! You seem to want me
to finish you off!
Then allow me to make
your wish come true!

Grrrrugh! Well met, "Hero"!
But I am not ready to admit
-
defeat yet...
I will draw you into the
Dark World!

Ho ho ho! It's great that you
could come all the way here,
Link.
And while I'm very happy
to see you again...
you'd better believe that we
will not have a third meeting!
Prepare to meet your doom!

Wah ha ha! What do you want,
little man? Do you have
something to ask me?
     I want the Flippers
     I just dropped by

Wah ha ha! But I don't just
give Flippers away for free.
I sell them for 500 Rupees a
pair.
What do you do?
     Pay 500 Rupees
     Quit after all

Wah ha ha! One pair of
Flippers coming up. I will
give you a free bonus with
your purchase.
I will let you use the magic
water ways of the sea folk
which link lakes and rivers.
When you see a whirlpool, dive
into it. You never know where
you'll surface! Wah ha ha!

Wade back this way when you
have more Rupees...
Wah ha ha! I'll see you again!

Great! Whenever you want to
see my fishy face, you are
welcome here.
...
Wah ha ha! Good-bye!

Hi Link!
Who? The old guy? You mean
the elder?
OK, but don't tell any of the
bad guys about this.
He's hiding in the palace past
the castle. I'll mark the spot
on your map.

Did you meet the old man? If
all the bad people go away, he
can come back to the village.

You're new here, aren't you?
Did you come here looking for
the Power of Gold?
Well, you're too late. It will
obey only the first person who
touches it.
The man who last claimed the
Power of Gold wished for this
world. It reflects his heart.
Yes, I came here out of greed
for the Golden Power, and
look what happened to me...
To restore the Golden Land, a
person worthy of the Golden
Power must defeat the man who
created this place...
Until that time, I am stuck in
this bizarre shape.
But what a mischievous thing
to leave lying around...
The Power of Gold...
Triforce...

   -Mysterious Pond-
Won't you throw something in?
-
What will you do?
     Throw an item
     Don't try it

Don't do it!

Don't do it!

I will give this back to you
then. Don't drop it again.

How many Rupees will you toss?
     00 Rupees
     00 Rupees

You are an honest person.
I like you.
I will give you something
important...
These are the Silver Arrows.
To deal the final stroke
to Ganon, you definitively need
them! I know I don't quite have
the figure of a fairy...
Ganon's cruel power
is to blame!
You must defeat Ganon!

-
Great luck.
-

-
Good luck.
-

-
A little luck.
-

-
Big trouble.

I will soothe your wounds and
comfort your weariness...
Close your eyes and relax...

Whoa-oh! Tumble tumble...
Hey! You were turned into
a bunny...
The terrain in this world looks
like the terrain in our world,
but it's just a little different.
And everyone who wanders into
this land is changed to a shape
that reflects his true nature.
I'm always changing my mind,
so I turned into a ball...
But if you have a ball called
the Moon Pearl, you can keep
your original shape here.

Whoa! Hey! You haven't
transformed! You're no
ordinary guy, are you?

Hey! What do you want?!
Do you got something to say
to me, silly rabbit?!
I came here to get the Golden
Power, but I can't go back to
the real world like this!
If I only had the Moon Pearl
from the Tower of Hera... Then
I could change back to the
way I was! I've got good
reason to be stressed out!
So back off! Now scram!

WOW! Your shape didn't change!
You got the Moon Pearl, huh?

In such a dangerous world you
may need many things. Select
something that you like...

Hi, may I help you? You can
open two chests for 30 Rupees.
Why don't you play?
What will you do?
     Play here
     Maybe next time

Well, come back and play some
time. I'll be waiting for you.
Until then, good-bye!

Hey kid!
You can open a chest after
paying Rupees!

You can't open any more
chests. The game is over.

All right, kid.
Choose well! Good luck!

May I help you? Select the
thing you like (Press the R
Button). Prices as marked!

You don't need that item...
Why not select something else?

Thank you very much.
Whenever you lose your shield,
come back here again.

Thank you very much.
This is the Medicine of Life.
It helps you recover your life.

Thank you very much.
These are arrows. You can't
use them without a Bow.

These are bombs.
Did you know you can pick up
a bomb you already placed?
(Press the R Button.)

Thank you very much.
That is a bee. Don't ask me
what it is used for, either.

Thank you very much.
You can recover one heart.

No no no... I can't sell the
merchandise because you don't
have an empty bottle.

You can't carry any more
now, but you may need
some later!

I never imagined a boy like you
could give me so much trouble.
It's unbelievable that you
defeated my alter ego, Agahnim
the Dark Wizard, twice!
But I will never give you the
Triforce. I will destroy you
and make my wish to conquer
both Light and Dark Worlds
come true without delay.

You are doing well, lad. But
can you break through this
secret technique of Darkness?
En garde!

Hey kid, this is a secret hide-
out for a gang of thieves!
Don't enter without permission!
By the way, I heard that one
of our ex-members is staying
at the entrance to the desert.

Yo Link! This house used
to be a hideout for a gang of
thieves.
What was their leader's name...
Oh yeah, his name was Blind and
he really hated bright light.

Welcome, Link...
I am the Essence of the
Triforce.
... ... ...
The Triforce will grant the
wishes in the heart and mind of
the person who touches it.
If a person with a good heart
touches it, it will make his good
wishes come true... If an evil-
hearted person touches it, it
grants his evil wishes.
The stronger the wish, the
more powerful the Triforce's
expression of that wish.
Ganon's wish was to conquer
the world. That wish changed
the Golden Land into
the Dark World.
After building up his power,
Ganon planned to go on to the
Light World to fulfill his wish.
But now that Ganon has been
destroyed, his Dark World will
surely vanish.
The Triforce is waiting for a
new master. Its Golden Power is
in your hands...
Now, touch it and think of
the wish in your heart.
...  ...  ...  ...

All right! Take it, thief!

Whoa... I saw her.
A beautiful young lady at the
Waterfall of Wishing in the
hills where the river
begins...
Link, you should meet her
at least once. I'm sure you will
like her.

Take some Rupees, but don't
tell anyone I gave them to you.
Keep it between us, OK?

Check out the cave east of
Lake Hylia. Strange and
wonderful things live in it...

You can earn a lot of Rupees
by defeating enemies. It's
the secret of my success...

Link, did you know that if
you destroy frozen enemies
with the Hammer, you will often
get a Magic Decanter?

Tra la la, look for
Sahasrahla. 
... ... ...

Oh yah, you found Sahasrahla!
... ... ...
Good job, la la!

I'm sorry, but you don't
seem to have enough Rupees...

Cluck cluck... What?!
You turned me into a human.
I can even speak!
Ah-ha! You must be the one who
is always teasing my friends.
The Weathervane has seen you
harass them.
This human shape is most
inconvenient for me.
Ahhh, I want to be a cucco
again! Cluck cluck...

Pay me 20 Rupees and I'll let
you open one chest. You can
keep what is inside.
What will you do?
     Open a Chest
     Escape

All right! Open whichever chest
you like!

Oh, I see... Too bad.
Drop by again after collecting
Rupees.

For 100 Rupees, I'll let you
open one chest and keep the
treasure that is inside.
What will you do?
     Open a Chest
     Escape

Hi, Link. Sorry about my
yard, but thanks for coming
through it to see me.
I'm glad to have someone to
talk to, so let me tell you an
interesting story...
These is a lake swimming with
Zoras at the source of the
river, but it is hard to find.
Tales say the Zoras' treasure
can turn people into fish.
Heh heh! I'd love to see that!

I haven't had a chance to trim
my hedges recently. Thanks
for visiting anyway...
A while ago, there was a boy in
this village who could talk to
animals with his flute.
And they say he met a bird
that flew him all around the
world. That must have been
some flute!

Welcome to the treasure field.
The object is to dig as many
holes as you can in 30 seconds.
Any treasures you dig up will
be yours to keep.
It's only 80 Rupees to play.

     I don't want to dig

Then I will lend you a shovel.
When you have it in your hand,

Sorry.

Oh, dear... That golden
bee is our pride.
-
I can't just give away a rare
bee like this.

Oh, my! You have a rare bee,
just like ours...
... ... ...
Maybe it's not quite as rare
as I thought it was.

Thank you very much!
That golden bee... Isn't
it a sparkling beauty?

Thank you very much!
That is a fairy.
Take good care of it!

Heh heh! Thanks!
Actually, only true heroes can
enter this palace.

Heh heh! Thanks! Actually, this
palace is here precisely for
heroes like you.
I bet you can get through it.
...But it will take everything
you've got!

Uhhnn... Link... I didn't
want you involved in this...
I told you not to leave home.
You must rescue Princess
Zelda...
You are... the princess's...
... ... ...

I have no strength left...
I can't cut the trees
like the giants.
But I am very good at
riddles.

Link! Instead of chopping
down trees, I learned some
woodcarving techniques!
If you can solve some of my
riddles, I'll make something
special for you!
Do you want to try?
     I'll try
     No thanks

I can make some pretty cool
things...

Take this basket. Put
whatever you think the right
item is in it and bring it to me.

You can get this if you're
quick with your Bug-Catching
Net. Now for the riddle!

Link! Did you figure out
the answer? Well? Where is it?
Show me what's in your basket!
Hey! You're right!
Ahhh! I can't believe it!
Fine. On to the next riddle!

Link! Did you figure out
the answer? Well? Where is it?

This time I'll give you the
carver's statue I made.
I'll send it to your house.
Now, on to the next riddle!

Link! Did you figure out
the answer? Well? Where is it?
Show me what's in your basket!
What?! You're right! Nooo! This
can't be! I'm no match for you!
I guess I'll teach you my
family's secret sword
technique...
Charge up your sword and
press the B Button many
times.
Then your charge will last
longer.

Awww... I can't think of any
more riddles...
-
Would you like to try a
technique? Charge up your
sword, then press the
B Button over and over
again.

Link! Did you figure out
the answer? Well? Where is it?
Show me what's in your basket!
Heh heh heh! WRONG!
I'll empty your basket for you,
so try again.

You learned a new sword
technique! Spin like a tornado
and cut your enemies down!
But watch your Magic Meter...

Cock-a-doodle-doo!
What is it? Go find it and
catch it with your bug-
catching net!

The scissors by the water...
What is it?

It's shiny and red.

BOOOM! Skitter-scatter...

Sprinkle and watch it wobble...
