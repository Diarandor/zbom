to our great King. His Majesty has tasked me with the documentation our young world's life, one that will be 
free of error and last unto the end of time. So that our descendants may recall the early days of the world's

that can be passed down from generation to generation; one that will record every detail of our new 
world's life, from beginning to end. To this end, I have enchanted this very book so that each new event that

<h2>PROGRESSION</h2><ul>
    <li />Ordon Village<ul>
	<li />Ordon Festival is underway! Talk to villagers (including <a href="#mayorulo">Mayor Ulo</a> who tells you to get his lantern out of his house), then race to win the Ordon Shield from the Blacksmith. Speak with <a href="#spiritordona">Spirit Ordona</a> (in a torch), then <a href="#julita">Julita</a> who directs you to the sewers to find <a href="#crista">Crista</a>. When she tells you about the sewer access, check it out to find the <a href="#ordonsword">Ordon Sword</a> then save her from ChuChus who appear afterward.<ul>
        <li />Shop (Shield, replacement costs 100 rupees. Bomb bag, can't get until after 2nd wallet. Potions included as well)</ul></ul>
	<li /><a href="#dungeon1">Eastern Ruins/Hyrulian Sewers (Ongoing Temple) - Earth/Shadow/Water themes</a>
    <li />Ordon Village<ul>
	<li />After getting shield and sword, head back to Ordon Village and talk to Ordona who directs you to Faron Woods to find the Sacred Grove. Near the grove the Deku and Tokay are having a conflict over who can have the area, with the Tokay having recently arrived and the Deku not liking it. Monkeys are also there, watching the drama unfold.</ul>
    <li /><a href="#dungeon2">Sacred Grove - Sacred Grove Temple (2nd) - Forest/Earth themes</a>
	<li />Upon leaving the temple, the monkeys steal your Book of Mudora page and run off through the woods to the beach.</ul>
    <li />Beach<ul>
	<li />Gerudo are there with their crashed ship, blocking access to the beach which they're claiming. They ask you to find parts to repair their ship (you not knowing they're turning it into an airship) and agree to leave the beach when you do. They tell you about the Abandoned Pyramid in the desert which should contain the parts they need. They can't get in because it requires a special power (chosen by the Triforce) and they see that you have it.</ul>
    <li /><a href="#dungeon3">Desert Expanse - Abandoned Pyramid (3rd) - Desert/Metal/Shadow themes (remnants of Lanayru Mining Facility)</a>
    <li />Beach<ul>
	<li />Give the parts to the Gerudo and they leave the beach for the desert (after informing Link of their true intentions). Return to the woods to tell the Tokay the beach is theirs, thereby resolving the turf war.</ul>
    <li />Faron Woods<ul>
	<li />The monkeys are bored now that the Deku/Tokay conflict is over, so they turn their attention to Link. They jump up into the trees, throwing the page back and forth between them. Link has to shake a tree to get a monkey out, and has to pick the right one with the page.
	<li />Dekus see the monkeys give the Book page back to Link and mention the existance of the Library and suggest how to access it from the sewers/ruins.</ul>
    <li />Kasuto Town - Ancient Library<ul>
	<li />Isan (Kasuto's page) tells you that Kasuto was killed by a group of strange people who were trying to use the Book of Mudora to cast a spell. He tells you about how Kasuto divided the Book of Mudora before he died and about the Library. Read what books you can in the library, more will be readable as you find more of the Book of Mudora. After some reading, talk to Isan again to receive a copy of the Hyrulean Bestiary to give to the Relic Collector in Castle Town in exchange for the Ocarina of Wind)</ul>
    <li />Ordon Village<ul>
	<li />Blacksmith's Cave (Will forge you a new sword if you can find metal ore)</ul>
    <li />Hyrule Castle Town<ul>
	<li />Shop (you can buy a Hylian Shield here, among other things)<ul>
        <li />Play mini-games (win the Big Wallet in the chest game)
	<li />Relic Collector's House contains a bottle and the Ocarina of Wind
        <li />Visit the castle and meet the Council of Elders - including Zelda. Cutscene where the Dark Tribe storms the castle.</ul></ul>
    <li />Kakariko City<ul>
        <li />Alchemist's Alehouse (Tavern)</ul>
<p>END OF DEMO 1!</p>
    <li />Goron City<ul>
	<li />A sickness spreading through the Goron population led them to build a great moutaintop Mausoleum a few years ago. An old Goron named Dampeh tended to it until an evil spirit took it over. Now Dampeh guards the Mausoleum, preventing people from going inside.
	<li />A Goron family is holed up in their house. The father is distraught because his son is sick and he can't do anything for him. He asks you to go find the doctor. The doctor can be found in another house (random?) by asking the other townsfolk (along the way you happen upon the Mountaintop Mausoleum, but Dampeh won't let you enter). When the doctor arrives, he tried to help the kid, but he ends up dying anyway. Later that night, the kid's ghost is seen floating toward the mausoleum where he leads you inside.</ul>
    <li /><a href="#dungeon4">Death Mountain - Mountaintop Mausoleum (4th) - Fire/Shadow themes</a>
    <li />With the evil gone from the Mausoleum, the sick gorons slowly start getting better. If you return the Goron City later, part of the mine will even be reopen!
    <li />Talking to most anyone in Ordon or Castle Town will direst you to the lumberjack living in Faron Woods. If you talk to him, he'll mention how he's heard stories of treasures being hidden BENEATH? Lake Hylia. He's seen grates nearby, but he has no idea how you would go about draining a whole lake!
    <li />Anyone you talk to in Kakariko will mention that the grates seen around Hyrule indicate a branch of the great Hyrule Sewers nearby. Sometimes you can even alter the land above from the sewers below!
    <li />To progress, you must return to the sewers and find the western branch. Flip a large switch to drain a large part of Lake Hylia above, and find the entrance to the Lakebed Lair (and the boomerang in the sewers) in the process.
    <li /><a href="#dungeon5">Lake Hylia - Lakebed Lair (5th) - Water/Forest themes</a>
<p>END OF DEMO 2!</p>

	<li />Notes: Temple is on-going through the first 1/4-1/3 of the game and requires you find multiple access in the overworld to progress in the temple. Puzzles mostly focus on water level in the lower sewers and defeating enemies and moving things in the upper ruins.</ul>
</a><a name="dungeon2">
    <li /><b>Sacred Grove - Sacred Grove Temple (2nd) - Forest/Earth themes</b><ul>
	<li />Miniboss: Mothulita swarm
	<li />Item: Bow
	<li />Boss: Gohma
	<li />Reward: Book of Mudora page
	<li />Major Enemies: Green ChuChus, Tentacles, Ropes, Keese, Green Tektites
	<li />Notes: Most straightforward temple with a dynamic similar to LoZ dungeons. Minor puzzles dealing with torches and enemies, and some inside-outside trekking.</ul>
</a><a name="dungeon3">
    <li /><b>Desert Expanse - Abandoned Pyramid (3rd) - Desert/Metal/Shadow themes (remnants of Lanayru Mining Facility)</b><ul>
	<li />Goal: Collect all of the parts needed to build the Gerudo Airship, take them back to the Gerudo who repair their ship and leave the beach. When you find them in their new home in the desert you have to chase them down to get the Boss Key.

	<li />Item: Bracelet
	<li />Boss: Manhandla
	<li />Reward: Book of Mudora page
	<li />Notes: Pyramid theme lends to there being Gibdos EVERWHERE! Also remnants of the mining facility means a lot of conveyor belts and plenty of boxes to move.</ul>
</a><a name="dungeon4">
    <li /><b>Death Mountain - Mountaintop Mausoleum (4th) - Fire/Shadow themes</b><ul>
	<li />Miniboss: Stone Arrghus

	<li />Item: Hookshot
	<li />Boss: Great Lizard Gleeok
	<li />Reward: Book of Mudora page
	<li />Notes: Since the Lake has been drained, this is a very non-traditional water dungeon. Only one or two (shallow) water rooms in the beginning, several rooms consist of mud and muck which act like quicksand (combination of running and pegasus boots and hookshotting past pits will be used). Later rooms have more water dynamic so some water can be returned to lake after temple is complete!</ul>
</a><a name="dungeon6">
    <li /><b>Snowpeak - Snowpeak Caverns (6th) - Ice/Spirit themes</b><ul>
	<li />Miniboss: Stalfos

	<li />Notes: </ul>
</a><a name="dungeon7">

	<li />Item: Light Shield
	<li />Boss: Helmaroc/Kargaroc
	<li />Reward: Book of Mudora (enchanted, complete)
	<li />Notes: Each level of the tower houses a different type of weather/wind.

Light shield used heavily (redirect ice blasts/beams, use light beams to make plants grow, absorb heat and send it out at ice, block wind gusts)
	<li />NB: The last two unique combinations not used in this tower are saved for the last dungeon (Electric/Earth - Light Storms, Electric - Heavy Storms)<ul>
		<li />Floor 1 (NW): Light Breezes (Earth)

	<li />Miniboss: Dark Link
	<li />Item: Light Arrows
	<li />Boss: Belahim (Dark Tribe Leader)
	<li />Notes: Large two-story palace. The top (entry) story will be almost completely dark, with very few lamps, so you must proceed almost blind. Few puzzles, but lots of enemies! The nearly last room will house a mini-boss fight with Dark Link. The bottom story will play like a game of Pente/Othello/Go, where each room can be switched to either light or dark by lamp-lighting puzzles, mirror shield reflection puzzles, Light Arrows, or some other dynamic. You win the game by lighting up five rooms in a row without Dark Link extinguishing them (playing board is the map), you can proceed to Belahim. As an added bonus, each room pays homage to various dungeons!</ul>
