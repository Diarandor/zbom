Hoffy's Original A Link to the Past Map Pack!

Featuring several maps Hoffy has tiled over the years for several long-gone projects. Some maps are less refined, whereas others are of the highest quality. Need a Kakariko Village map? Check. Kakariko Graveyard? Check. Completed Hyrule Field? Check. Original towns and forest areas? You better believe it.

With that, there are several credits that need to be realised when using these maps in your fan games. Please take note of the follow credits for each map...
