  - Kakariko village (mostly inside)
  - Snowpeak to the north

Scripts:
  - Octorok: get movement and shooting correct
  - Big Poe: flies toward Link, but disappears every so often. Throws fire from lantern. Takes three hits to kill
  - Little Poes: just fly around- randomly, then occasionally toward Link. Each take one hit to kill
  - Moldorm: Normal Moldorm behavior, hit tail three times to kill
  - Compass item in dungeon: add tone when secret is in a room (like Link's Awakening)

  - Giga: Goron version of the Redead - slower moving but much more powerful when they attack

LONG TERM:
  - Day/Night System: Not time-based, have to go to sleep in a bed to change between the two- like SS
  - Lamp/Light:
	- varying levels of light: use surfaces with varying alpha
	- ability to burn things with lamp: may already be in lamp script?
	- effects when Ordona is speaking: can use surfaces of different colors/alphas to accomplish - would like to have particles if ever possible
  - More emphasis on the shop/rupees: add quest-specific items that must be bought for a large number of rupees (like LA and kinda ALBW)
  - More options in trading sequence - one item may be traded for any number of items in different physical locations (a shopkeeper in Kakariko may sell/trade the item or you could trade for free to a character in Hyrule Castle Town)
