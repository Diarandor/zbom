LONG TERM:
  - Energy/Stamina system
	- Stamina decreases by a small amount (1 unit) anytime an item is used
	- Apples restore stamina, but work less and less well each time
	- Sleeping at inns restores stamina and restores the effect of apples
	- Stamina bar increases the more it's used and restored
	- Maximum stamina starts at 200 and can increase to 500 (or maybe as high as 1000?)
  - Lamp/Light:
	- varying levels of light: use surfaces with varying alpha
	- ability to burn things with lamp: may already be in lamp script?
  - More emphasis on the shop/rupees: add quest-specific items that must be bought for a large number of rupees (like LA and kinda ALBW)
  - More options in trading sequence - one item may be traded for any number of items in different physical locations (a shopkeeper in Kakariko may sell/trade the item or you could trade for free to a character in Hyrule Castle Town)
