-- Dialogs of NPCs

-- NPC dialogs share a very specific identifier syntax which correlates to
-- when they are to be displayed. Parts are sectioned off by periods.
-- Part one: Character's name
-- Part two: Minimum reputation required for dialog. Reputation is tracked
-- for each character as a save game variable (reserved range from 1900 to
-- 1999) and is changed upon speaking to a character. Usually, simply talking
-- to someone is enough to increase or decrease Rep by 1 (sometimes depending
-- on answers to questions), while completing tasks, quests or minigames may
-- increase (or decrease) by several points. Rep can range from -10 to 50.
-- Part three (optional): Section to clarify the area or situation in the NPC
-- should be in when this message is displayed.
-- Part four (optional): Integer indicating that there are multiple messages
-- which can be randomply selected from
 
-- *** MAJOR CHARACTERS (those seen at different point throughout the game and integral to plot) ***
-- Include: Crista, Tristan, Ordona, Rudy, Ulo, Zelda, Juba, Gin, Larin, Gonpho, Koshi, Carock, Zirna, Belahim, etc.
