to Castle Town! This is
almost in the center of
Hyrule. Kakariko, Death
Mountain and Snowpeak
are to the north. Lon Lon
Ranch is directly to the
west, with Lake Hylia
beyond that and the
desert on the other side.$0
The now abandoned Hidden
Village is directly to
the east, through the
trees. Then is Zora's
Domain and the rest of
Death Mountain including
Goron City.$0
Oh! I almost forgot the
coolest thing! You know
about warp points?$0
Well, somewhere in town
is an instrument known
as the Ocarina of Wind
which will allow you to
instantly transport to
different places. In fact,
the structure with the
cardinal directions up
there will take you to
the four corners of the
world! How cool is that?!

The beach looks pretty
empty without those cool
lizard people around -
"Tokay" I think is what
they're called? And those
crabs are sure mean!
Anyway, you're at the
end of the beach and the
desert is just ahead. At
the far north end is a
really old pyramid thing.
I've seen a few Gerudo
tents on the west end
of the desert, and if
you go far enough east
you'll hit the waters
of Lake Hylia. If you
could swim, you could
probably get there from
the beach too.$0
If you cross the bridge
at the end of the desert
you'll end up at the
City of Kakariko. I'd
recommend chatting with
the guy in the house
near there too.
