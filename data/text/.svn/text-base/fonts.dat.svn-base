# This file defines the fonts available to the game engine.
# The engine relies on 3 fonts named 'dialog', 'dialog_big' and 'fixed'.
# The main purpose of this file is to make the engine independant from the font file names.

[dialog]
# the font used in dialog boxes
file = text/la.ttf
size = 11
default = true

[dialog_big]
# same as 'dialog' but bigger
file = text/la.ttf
size = 18

[fixed]
# fixed-width font used in the menus
file = text/fixed8.fon
size = 11
